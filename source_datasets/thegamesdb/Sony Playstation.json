Among the innovations in Madden 96, the Create A Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player. The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret \"classic\" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win).

Throughout the planet of Arrakis (a desert-like planet riddled with dunes and sand), three military powers have engaged in a fierce war to control a most prized resource known as the Spice Melange. The mysterious spice can only be found on the planet of Arrakis; every race in the known universe lusts for its power.\r\n\r\nWith all the bickering and fighting over Spice Melange, the Emperor has issued a challenge that basically states whoever controls the substance will control Arrakis. The three aforementioned forces include the noble House Atreides, the wicked House Harkonnen, and the enigmatic House Ordos. Not only does each house desire control, they also have different reasons for entering the war.\r\n\r\nThe House Atreides loathes and fears the evil forces of the Harkonnen and wishes to form an alliance with the Fremen, strange sand-dwelling warriors that inhabit the bowels of the planet. The nobles function much like a normal army, giving commands for the side of good. On the other hand, House Harkonnen is run by a tyrannical baron that demands victory. These blood-drinking savages enjoy battles and chaos more than the actual victory; they reign with widespread fear. House Ordos is a bit more unorthodox than their warring brethren. Led by cyborg-like officers, they go into battle with a strategic mentality and play for the odds. Gut feelings aren't acceptable in their society. Having arrived with Lady Alara on the desertous Arrakis, she has enlisted you as a commander of one of the three military powers. Her sisterhood is hoping that you will be victorious with that house above all others, as to create a clear faction in control of the Spice Melange in which her Order could form an alliance.\r\n\r\nAfter selecting the house of your liking, a commander will give you a military briefing and objective. As a 3D real-time strategy game, you'll begin by constructing a series of battle units, important housing structures (walls, construction yards, barracks, outposts) and vehicles; this is vital in order to meet the mission objective. You'll start the scenario with a power supply for building a Spice Melange refinery to generate money. Afterwards, it's up to you to build a fully operational base. Upon completion of the necessary structures, it's time to attack your opposition! You'll command and control a wide variety of light infantry soldiers, troopers, saboteurs, and the aforementioned Fremen.\r\n\r\nDune 2000 also supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller for analog movements and the vibration function.

For a mysterious reason, Gizarov chooses only one small town, called Gotaal. Immediately after having the town in his possession, Gizarov presses the population with heavy taxes. Landius, the son of Gotaal's mayor, fails to convince Gizarov to stop raising the taxes, and as a result, he has no other choice but to support the people in rebellion...\r\n\r\nThe game returns to the traditional gameplay style of the first two Langrisser games. You create your character and choose his class by answering questions in the beginning of the game (similar to Ultima games). Before the battles, you should recruit mercenaries, buy weapons and items, etc. Once in battle mode, you command several units led by stronger generals. Each unit has its own \"judgment\" ability\"; units with high judgment ability will perform more moves during a turn.\r\n\r\nThe story of Langrisser V is closely connected to the one told in Langrisser IV - the two games form a kind of a sub-series within the Langrisser universe. \r\n\r\nThe game's plot revolves around Sigma, an artificial human created by the great warlock and scientist Gizarov. One say, Sigma is awakened from his sleep inside a storage crystal in one of Gizarov's labs by Lambda, a girl who was also created by the scientist. Apparently, a powerful lord named Rainforce has invaded Gizarov's laboratory with the intention of destroying it. Meanwhile, a powerful artificial human called Omega, another \"child\" of Gizarov, distracts Rainforce. The two heroes flee to Regenburg, a country under Gizarov's rule, only to find out that they will soon have to stop a greater evil endangering the world - a new leader of darkness, who is after the powerful evil sword Alhazard...\r\n\r\nLangrisser V features classical Langrisser-style gameplay: you prepare your units before a battle, buy items etc., and in battle control various types of army units (archers, pikemen, etc.), together with the generals. The \"Judgment System\" from the previous game is back: your units can perform several moves per turn depending on their \"judgment level\".

It came out on the 15th anniversary of the original Zanac.\r\n\r\nZanac X Zanac consists of two separate games; the original Zanac(in various iterations) and the debut of Zanac Neo. It can best be described as part classic compilation, part updated re-imagining of the original.\r\n\r\nZanac\r\nZanac is a top down, 2D, vertical scrolling, space shooter. Gameplay consists of frantic scrambles between dodging bullets, shooting down enemies, and powering-up your spacecraft. The original Zanac game released in Japan in 1986 for the MSX home computer and the Family Computer Disk System(Famicom Disk System). Zanac proved to be one of Compile's more popular titles thanks to it's eventual US release on the Nintendo Entertainment System that same year.\r\n\r\nThere are two things that may stand-out to Zanac players; it's frantic pace, and it's ever-changing playfield. Rarely are two games of Zanac identical. This is due to the games innovative use of the company coined \"A.I.\" system. The game was programmed in a manner that gives a slightly different experience with each play. Things such as enemy type, enemy speed, and enemy placement are adjusted in real-time based on the players skill level, number of lives, and power-up configuration(similar to \"rank\" systems found in shooters such as Battle Garegga many years later). Many shooters at the time relied on pattern memorization. Zanac demands a player to be ever mindful of the dynamic play-field.\r\n\r\nWeapon Power-Ups\r\n\r\nAt the start of a game, or a new life, the player may feel terribly under-powered. However, Zanac has a robust power-up system that allows your spacecraft to become very powerful. A rapid and constant cycle between the player feeling under-powered one second then awesomely overpowered the next is typical throughout a game of Zanac. The player starts with a standard rapid-fire shot(pea shooter), and a \"0\" level sub-weapon.\r\n\r\nThe sub-weapon can be changed or upgraded several times depending on the players tastes/gameplay situation. This is done through collecting floating power-ups during gameplay which are numbered ranging from \"0\" to \"7\". Each number represents a different type of sub-weapon with a unique form of attack. By collecting different numbers, the player will switch sub-weapons. By collecting the same number the players current sub-weapon is upgraded to become more powerful, up to 3 times.\r\n\r\nThe players standard rapid-fire shot can also be upgraded by collecting a different type of power-up in the form of yellow \"orbs\". The orbs are only found within blue blocks that scroll down from the top of the screen. The blocks must be shot apart to reveal the possible orb within. Some blocks do not house orbs, and instead treat the player to a scatter-shot of deadly bullets. Other than powering-up the standard rapid-fire shot, another key component of the orbs are that when they're collected they provide momentary invulnerability. This is a key strategic maneuver if you plan to last through the difficult levels of Zanac.\r\n\r\nIncluded versions of Zanac\r\n\r\nZanac X Zanac contains two classic iterations of the the original Zanac as well as two exclusive modes:\r\n\r\n- \"Disk Version\"(Family Computer Disk System version)\r\n\r\n- \"Rom Version\"(Nintendo Entertainment System version)\r\n\r\n- \"Special Version\"(enhanced graphics/sound, exclusive mode)\r\n\r\n- \"Score Trial\"(single level score attack, exclusive mode, also in Neo)\r\n\r\nEach version includes a \"save\" and \"load\" feature. This allows for recoding of high-scores and the ability to continue from the level previously reached. Continues are unlimited however, your score will reset upon \"Game Over\". These features are also included in Zanac Neo.\r\n\r\nZanac Neo\r\nZanac Neo is a top down, 2D, vertically scrolling space shooter. The game shares nearly the same gameplay as the original Zanac. The signature \"0\" - \"7\" numbered power-up system makes a return, as well as the yellow orbs that augment your standard shot and provide momentary invulnerability. The graphics, music, and sound effects have all been updated. More detailed and interesting backgrounds were added to the levels, and music from the original game returns in remix form.\r\n\r\nOne of the major additions to \"Neo\" is being able to select from 3 different ships upon starting the game. Each ship has slightly different movement/shooting properties and each have slightly different sub-weapon implementation. In the spirit of the original game, there are still 8 different sub-weapons that can be picked-up and upgraded during play, allowing for a variety of unique weapon combinations for each ship.\r\n\r\nAnother addition comes in the form of a new type of \"power-shot\". As enemies are destroyed a bar fills at the bottom of the screen allowing for the player to unleash a powerful beam shot. When the bar is completely filled a bomb can also be fired that can clear enemies and/or set-off a chain reaction of orb-block explosions.\r\n\r\nZanac Neo supports two player simultaneous play, a first in Zanac history.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:33", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Compile"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation", "developers": ["Treasure"], "id": 23756, "game_title": "Rakugaki Showtime", "release_date": "1999-07-29", "platform": 10, "players": 2, "overview": "Rakugaki Showtime is a game along the same vein as Poitter's Point (Also known as Poy Poy )where in you try to defeat the opponents by throwing things at them. \r\n\r\nSTORY: \r\nWelcome to the world of Rakugaki. An imaginary game world, created entirely by the pencil drawings of the \"God Hand\". The characters who inhabit this world were created by the God Hand in the same way... Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitanand Tsubohachi; the four members of the \"Heroes Team\", and Daddy; who commands the mysterious enemy character army. \r\n\r\nCalled the \"Heroes and Enemies\", they are all controlled by their master, and follow their predetermined (created?) fate. Today a battle to the end unfolds... \r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY: \r\nRakugaki Showtime you play as a rakugaki (scribble) character, who must fight against other rakugaki characters in a square 3D arena. The fights mainly consist of throwing items at the opposition. However, throwing is not as simple as \"pick up, aim & throw\". In Rakugaki Showtime different \"drives\" can be placed on the thrown items by holding different directions whilst throwing. Holding the direction towards the target will cause a \"Forward Drive Throw\", which is like a faster normal throw, albeit weaker. Holding the direction away from the target will cause you to do a \"Backward Drive Throw\", which will cause your character to throw the item slower and in an arc, but it will cause far more damage. \r\n\r\nBy performing a \"Counter\", you are able to block most items thrown at you. If your timing is off, the Item will just bounce off you and drop down. But if you \"Counter\" just before the item hits you, your character will perform a \"Donpisha Counter\" (Donpisha means to trigger immediately), which causes the item to be reflected back at the original thrower. \r\n\r\nOne of the more important items in the game is a Smiley Ball. Unlike all other items, Smiley Balls will not be destroyed after use. Instead, every impact will slowly make the Smiley Ball go from yellow to magenta, from happy to angry. After it gets very angry, a sound clip of \"halleluja\" will play and the Smiley will be engulfed in flashing white light... it has become a Super Smiley. When you pick up a Super Smiley, you will not throw it. Instead, your rakugaki will unleash their \"Super Smiley Attack\", which in most cases is devestating. Also, your fighter may be able to use different Super Smiley Attack's by applying different drives, these are called Forward Super Smileys and the Backward Drive Super Smileys. \r\n\r\nLike every other fighting game that has ever existed, you can execute Special Moves. These usually consist of very basic button commands involving the directional buttons and generally the Circle button. Some characters have a whole arsenal of Special Moves, others only have only a handful. \r\n\r\nAround the stages are \"Item Points\", these are where the God Hand will draw the Items to be used in battle. You can make your character move to these points quickly by performing a \"Homing Dash\". To do this, jump, hold the direction you want to go and then hit the jump button again. You will fly over to the point you indicated. As well as item points, you can use a \"Homing Dash\" to quickly fly over to Smiley Balls, this is EXTREMELY helpful. You are also able to \"Chain Homing Dashes\", to do this, just hold the jump button down after doing a Homing Dash, and tap the direction of another item point before you land. You can cancel Homing Dashes mid-flight by pressing the Circle Button. \r\n\r\nGAME MODES: \r\n- Normal Mode: In this mode, you battle enemies in set stages. The difficulty differs depending on your performance, where doing badly (i.e. losing two times in arow) nets you crappy characters (e.g. Zacko) whereas doing well rewards youwith really good characters. At first you will only be able to play as Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitan and Tsubohachi, but everytime you complete the game you will unlock another character. There are 12 stages you must battle through, ending with a final rumble against the God Hand. \r\n- Versus Mode: In versus mode, you can battle to other three players or computer rtvals. \r\n- Training Mode: Here you select a character to fight against a Zacko who has an absurd amount of life and hardly enough brain cells to fill a pore on the human face. This isgood to test out damage for the different moves of your character. The missions are as follows: 1) Use the Smiley Ball 2) Use Items 3) Test your skills. \r\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \r\n- Yukiwo: Yukiwo is the standard well-rounded protagonist. He has an above averageamount of health, at 3928 HP. His running speed is Fairly Fast, and his Homing Dash speed is pretty Average. \r\n- Sasami: Sasami is a very agile fighter.she's skilled in the Kung Fu Arts. Both her running and Homing Dash speeds are Fast, which will allow her to run rings against most of the opposition. She is fairly \"light-weight\" though, only having 2333 HP. She only has a couple of Special Moves, and they are all pretty weak. \r\n- Pitan: Pitan is a cute mischievous monk, who speaks in Kansai Ben.. He has 3001 HP, his running speed is Fast,and his Homing Dash speed is Fairly Fast. Apart from being speedy, Pitan's greatest advantage over the others are his highly useful Super Smiley Attacks. \r\n- Tsubohachi: Tsubohachi is Pitan's unruly drunk of a father. He is constantly referred to as \"OYAJI\", which is somewhat Japanese slang for \"My Old Man\", \"Geezer\", etc. Tsubohachi is one of the most enjoyable characters to play as. Whilst your controlling him, he won'tfollow your commands 100% correctly, which gives you the feeling of playing as a drunk. It's a brilliant touch to this character. Tsubohachi has a very decent amount of health, at 4802 HP, and his running and Homing Dash speed are both very random. Relying on whether your pushing against or with the way he's staggering.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:55:25", "rating": "E - Everyone", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Enix Corporation"], "alternates": ["\u30e9\u30af\u30ac\u30ad\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0"]}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation", "developers": ["Gremlin Interactive Ltd."], "id": 23776, "game_title": "Actua Soccer 3", "release_date": "1998-12-04", "platform": 10, "players": 2, "overview": "Actua Sports was a sports video game series published by Gremlin Interactive which competed with Electronic Arts EA Sports label during the second half of the 1990s, until Gremlin was acquired by Infogrames.

Currently, it spans 25 volumes. \r\n\r\nIn Bastard?, the Kingdom of Meta-Rikana is attacked by four armies. This prompts Dark Schneider, a wizard, to awaken within the body of 14-year old Lucian Lenren. \r\n\r\nBastard?'s history is about sorcery, revenge, and other power struggles in a Dungeons & Dragons-like world. It is a dystopian world, where people need magic to survive against wild beasts, and evil monsters. There are endless rulers, each one with his own army of knights and mages, who fight for survival against those beasts and the armies of multiple evil sorcerers. \r\n\r\nIn the anime, the six episodes tell of the awakening of Dark Schneider (also called Darsh or Darshu by those who know him well) and his subsequent attempts to destroy his old allies (The Four Lords of Havoc) and take over the world, whilst winning over multiple love interests. Dark Schneider had been imprisoned fifteen years earlier, trapped inside the body of Yoko's friend Lucien following a failed attempt to take over the world. In the meantime, his four generals attempted to resurrect the god Anthrasax, who would bring about an apocalypse and create the Sorcerer's Kingdom from the ashes of the old world. \r\n\r\nThe story takes place in the future, a post-apocalyptic time following the release of Anthrasax at the height of Modern Civilization. Technology is gone and magic has asserted itself as a force in the world. Shortly after the fall of the modern world, demonic creatures began to appear en masse and forced humans to revert to a feudalistic, city-state based society.

Each time period is a scenario which presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period.\r\n\r\nThe player uses a joystick and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues\u2014highlighted portions of the background or foreground\u2014will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on the location of the cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.", "last_updated": "2018-07-17 03:58:29", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": "XEKoRKljTdU", "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Taito Corporation"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation", "developers": ["Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo"], "id": 25555, "game_title": "Detana TwinBee Yahho!

There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin. \r\n\r\n- Hyper Sports 2 (1985):\r\nThree tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game.

Coins are arranged and colored to match denominations of the yen coins. Two bonus tiles allow for changes in gameplay.

And everything around then has amounted to come to nothing. Advanced alchemy has caused environmental disruption. The world has been filled with evil creatures. And the human beings have threatened with extinction. Meanwhile, the sun god, Amaterasu appeared from the sky to human, and told. \"The brave young man Huey and Siria. I grant you this sacred saber.\" \"Show your good spirit!\" \r\n\r\n- Wonder Momo (1987): A beat 'em up arcade game that was released exclusively in Japan by Namco in 1987. It runs on Namco System 86 hardware, and was later ported to the PC-Engine in 1989. It is Namco's last 8-bit arcade game. This game was never released outside of Japan, probably because of its slightly questionable content. Momo is a young girl who gets super-powers, hence becoming Wonder Momo and battling costumed villains. \r\n\r\n- Rompers (1989): an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware. \r\nYou control a guy wearing a straw hat named Chap who must collect all of the keys in 61 maze-like gardens while avoiding various enemies to rescue his girlfriend, Rumina. He can push the walls over to crush the enemies, but they will come back as eggs which will hatch after a few seconds. There is also a strict time limit to ensure you don't dawdle. \r\n\r\n- Motos (1985): An arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy. It has 62 levels. \r\nThe player must maneuver a bumper car to bump enemies off the edge of the playfield while they attempt to do the same to it. Power-ups give the car extra bumping power and the ability to jump over gaps in the playfield. \r\n\r\n- Sky Kid (1985): A horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster. It is also the first game from Namco to allow 2 players to play simultaneously. The game was later released on the Famicom (brought to the American NES by Sunsoft), and this version was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service in North America on May 19, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. A sequel named Sky Kid Deluxe was released in 1986. It introduced several new enemies and missions. \r\nThe players play as the Sky Kids \"Red Baron\" and \"Blue Max\", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le M\u00e9rite, informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. \r\n\r\n- King & Balloon (1980): A fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1980. It runs on Namco Galaxian hardware but with an extra Z80 processor to drive a DAC for speech; the King speaks when he is captured (\"HELP!\"), when he is rescued (\"Thank you\"), and when he is carried away (\"BYE BYE!\"). Additionally, the balloons make the same \"droning\" sound as the ships in Galaxian, which was released the previous year. The player's shots also have the same sound effect as the player ship in said game. \r\nThe player controls two green men (likely soldiers in the king's army) with an orange cannon that fires at squads of descending balloons. You must protect the king and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons. \r\n\r\n- Rolling Thunder (1986): A run and gun arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986. It runs on the Namco System 86 hardware platform and was licensed for US distribution to Atari Games.

The game features 22 levels spread throughout 7 missions, with 12 authentic weapons, including the pistol crossbow and the Panzerfaust.

The player can: adjust the tires to fit the road (hard for ovals or soft for road courses), as well as modify gear ratios and aerodynamics.

While the options are fantastic and the graphics are gorgeous, the playbook is a layperson's nightmare - and game control is extremely frustrating. College football fans just shouldn't have to come so close, yet still be so far....\r\n\r\nFirst, the good news: GameBreaker will be a treat for college football fans, whose games usually play second-fiddle to the bigger, badder NFL slamfests. GameBreaker runs on the new, improved GameDay engine, and has the options and small touches to bring out the school spirit in anyone. Then there's all those teams, displayed in fantastic motion-captured graphics. And let's not forget the abundant animation capped off with excellent pep band music and an echoing announcer's voice. In short, this game is simply gorgeous. It's easily the best-looking college football game anywhere.\r\n\r\nWait, sit back down.\r\n\r\nGameBreaker is knocked out of the game thanks to its atrocious playbook interface. There's little doubt the designers meant well when they compiled the mother lode of all playbooks. But the options are so numerous (and so spread out) that it's far too difficult to find the right play for the right situation. Even the special teams section is hidden, meaning there's no choice but to cycle through the entire menu to find it. With seconds left and no time outs, the last thing anyone wants to do is peruse the playbook. Simple features could have made play selection so much easier: For example, on fourth down, the special teams box could (and should) have been front and center. And if that isn't enough....\r\n\r\nGameBreaker's got a tough one-player game - one so hard that even an experienced thumb-back can end up losing to the worst teams on the easiest level. This fact is largely attributable to the computer's ability to instantly find the perfect play and perfectly execute it (complete with precisely-timed stiff-arms). This may present a great challenge for the experienced, but players new to console football won't enjoy it at all...and with four difficulty settings to choose from, this is inexcusable.\r\n\r\nThis all adds up to put college football fans in a tough spot: There're plenty of frills, but no gameplay. College football freaks will enjoy this game despite the tough interface and gameplay. But first-timers (and NFL mavens used to the easy handling of GameDay, Quarterback Club, and even Madden) won't like what they find. Simply put, this game's not ready for the big leagues. --Hugh Sterbakov \r\n--Copyright \u00a91999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Case in point: Acclaim's new NFL Quarterback Club 97 for the Playstation. Compared to EA's brilliant Madden NFL '97, NFL Quarterback Club 97 is simply second-rate. Though NFL Quarterback Club 97 does have some merits, there's not enough here to make it worth its hefty price.\r\n\r\nNFL QB Club utilizes many of the same gameplay elements seen in Madden '97 - including the kicking T-meter, the three-quarter overhead primary camera angle, and the button assignments and controls. Player animations are fluid and realistic (the tackles are some of the best going), and the large - though a tad cartoony - player sprites have clearly visible jersey numbers and names. However, the players never seem to move quickly enough: For example, the great Emmitt Smith lumbers downfield as though he's running in sand. Inclement weather options, like snow and rain, look ridiculous. Moreover, penalties are highly unrealistic, with defensive and offensive pass interference called at least once during every set of downs (while almost nothing else is called throughout the entire game). And how could there be no coin toss to determine who kicks and who receives? Sheesh.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, NFL QB Club 97 boasts a singularly impressive feature: a historic simulation mode. Players can choose among 50 different classic NFL game situations and try to rewrite history. Imagine...it's December 23, 1973. The Dallas Cowboys are down 28-13 to the 49ers. With under a minute remaining, the Boys score a TD and recover an onside kick. Can you complete one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history? It's this type of do-or-die drama that the game's historic sim mode provides. And if that's not enough, there's a custom simulation mode, which allows gamers to create and save up to five game situations, right down to the exact game circumstances (weather, time remaining, score, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhile this game has some admirable qualities, in the end it falls short of the high standards set by Madden '97. Unless you harbor a deep hatred for John Madden and his know-it-all wisecracks, leave NFL Quarterback Club 97 on the shelves.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:40", "rating": "E - Everyone", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Acclaim Entertainment, Inc."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation", "developers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "id": 42742, "game_title": "Playstation Underground Volume 4 Issue 1", "release_date": "2000-03-01", "platform": 10, "players": 1, "overview": "This first issue of year four opens with another view of the blimp, but this time missiles are being shot at it.

The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot 'em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work.\r\n\r\nYou have a single ship choice and three difficulties. Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD, which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL, and isn't particularly challenging anyway. You get two extra credits in NORMAL, for a total of 5, which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending. No one should touch EASY, since it limits you to reaching Stage 4. There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings, none of which are affected by credit usage.\r\n\r\nPower-ups consist of 2 main shots (RED and BLUE), 2 sub-weapons (YELLOW and GREEN), and an \u0081eIntense Shot' based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb. Main weapons stack up to 3 times (RED: starts on 1 shot then 2, 3 and finally 4 shots), sub-weapons don't stack. Lose a ship and you lose your sub-weapon, while your main weapon goes down one level.\r\n\r\nBLUE is the Laser Shot, a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it. The laser's \u0081eintense shot' is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path. RED is Needle Shot. This is your typical V-shot weapon. Less powerful than BLUE, but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread. The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses, making this the best main weapon. GREEN is the Cipher Wave, the best sub-weapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you, which is essential during boss fights. YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional V-shot weapon. Absolute rubbish.\r\n\r\nWith such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the game's duration. Which isn't a criticism. Gaia Seed doesn't distract you with superfluity; it's functional, with a focus on dodging and shooting. What's especially cool, and sets it apart from other shmups, is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging. This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health - but it doesn't break the game's balancing.\r\n\r\nEnemies frequently use screen-filling beam-based draining weapons, forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beam's attack before your life is fully drained. With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance - especially if you're trying to beat them by letting the timer run down (those are some pretty intense 120 seconds). After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screen's edge, healing while avoiding bullet patterns. The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving. A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine, which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance (as pointed out by Mag Weasel).\r\n\r\nA mention must go to Gaia Seed's timed bosses. Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesn't do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment, but if you want to see the best ending you'll let the two final Stage 7 bosses' live.\r\n\r\nVisually almost everything is sprite based, though it varies in terms of quality. The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around, while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects. Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling, though not as good as in Thunder Force IV. Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair.\r\n\r\nThe stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack, which almost warrants download alone. It's extremely unconventional, being a blend of ambient music with chanting, classical music, hip-hop and thumping techno. Stage 2's track almost sounds as if it's been taken from Panzer Dragoon Saga. It's eclectic, strange, and very good. The sole composer was Xacs Ishikawa, also known as Naoto Ishikawa, a fairly obscure composer connected to works like Psyvariar and Touhou. Interestingly, he also collaborated with Harumi Shiina to remix Koji Endo's King's Field soundtrack, to create an album called Invitation to the Graveyard ~ King's Field I Arrange Collection.", "last_updated": "2018-12-12 17:27:10", "rating": "Not Rated", "coop": "No", "youtube": "", "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": null, "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation", "developers": ["Warashi"], "id": 43232, "game_title": "The Shooting: Kagaku Ninja-Tai Gatchaman", "release_date": "2002-06-27", "platform": 10, "players": null, "overview": "Gatchaman: The Shooting is a vertical shoot 'em up based on the Japanese manga/anime with the same name (Known as Battle of the Planets in the US).

In 1998, the game was released with Image Fight as a one-disc doublebill on PlayStation and Sega Saturn.\r\nThe game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249\u2014the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.\r\n\r\nImage Fight (\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8) is a 1988 vertically scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game developed and published by Irem. The arcade game was also ported for the Nintendo Entertainment System, PC Engine (Japan-only), Sharp X68000 (Japan-only), and FM Towns (Japan-only) in 1990.\r\n\r\nThe player flies a futuristic red ship. R-Type Final identifies this ship as the OF-1 Daedalus, but it is not known if that was the ship's original name. However, the term OF-1 does appear in the NES version's instruction manual, as well as in the official artwork for the sequel, Image Fight II. The game appears to be set inside a holographic simulator, like the holodeck on Star Trek: The Next Generation.

This provokes much jealousy in Asuka, who also suspects that Kirishima is a spy who is trying to get information from Shinji about NERV and the Evas. Rei Ayanami is present but plays a rather background role in the story, though she seems to agree with the suspicions of Asuka. Gradually, a relationship between Mana and Shinji unfolds and they end up going on a date. It turns out, however, that Mana is one of three test pilots for the TRIDENT (alternatively named the \"Country Crawler\") units, a new competitor to the Evangelions, similar to Jet Alone; thus the name Girlfriend of Steel. Eventually, the TRIDENT goes berserk and the Evas have to destroy it.\r\n\r\nThe interactivity in most of the game is limited to walking around areas until the next plot event is triggered. However, the one true branch occurs at the end of the game, where the player may choose to focus on Mana, Asuka or Kaji. This choice determines which of the game's three endings are shown, with a fourth exclusive to the PS2.\r\n\r\nIn the Mana ending, Mana is discovered not to have been killed in the battle. Shinji rescues her and brings her back to his apartment. She showers, emerges wearing only a towel, and teasingly asks Shinji if he would like her to remove it (which she eventually does). In discussion with Misato, however, it is agreed that Mana has to leave Tokyo-3, and she says a teary goodbye to Shinji who has won her heart.\r\n\r\nIn the Asuka ending, Asuka helps Shinji to get over Mana and the two children grow closer as a result. This ending contains romantic images of Asuka and Shinji together, including a moving scene where Asuka hugs Shinji emotionally.\r\n\r\nThe third ending with Kaji does not focus on any one character as much as the other endings do. Mana is also discovered not to be killed, and says goodbye, with Shinji replying \"I'll be waiting for you\".", "last_updated": "2018-07-06 22:32:55", "rating": "E - Everyone", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Life Simulation"], "publishers": ["Gainax"], "alternates": ["Neon Genesis Evangelion - Koutetsu no Girlfriend"]}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation", "developers": null, "id": 45965, "game_title": "Night Raid", "release_date": null, "platform": 10, "players": null, "overview": null, "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:41", "rating": null, "coop": null, "youtube": null, "genres": null, "publishers": null, "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation", "developers": ["Killer Game"], "id": 46144, "game_title": "NHL FaceOff '97", "release_date": "1996-10-31", "platform": 10, "players": 4, "overview": "NHL FACEOFF '97 has all the basic features you've come to expect from a hockey game.

Consisting of 12 mini games. The stars of the game are two penguins, Rocky and Hopper who run a detective agency. One day they get hired by Pinky the penguin to search for her lost cat. Seeing a possibility to earn a quick buck, Brownie joins in the search. During their adventure, the cat is kidnapped by an evil scientist, which happens to be a poodle. \r\n\r\nThese story segments are all presented in FMV and add lots of humor to the game. Adding to the craziness of it all are FMV commercials that can be unlocked by completing the story mode. In these you can see Rocky and Hopper star in Japanese spots for a product called \"Super Hard\" hair mousse. \r\n\r\nBut what the game really is about. is the minigames. These are fun when played alone, but when played with 2-4 people the craziness of this game really starts to shine through. 4 players can play using a multitap, but also by sharing just 2 controllers and selecting the strangely called \"Love Mode\". \r\n\r\nMinigames range from memory games, where one must flip 2 cards at a time and try to match animal sounds to score points, up to a little shooting gallery where you have to avoid shooting the kitty and must try to shoot the evil poodle before someone else does. \r\n\r\nAnother game has you dialing a phone number as quick as possible. All numbers on the phone are presented by buttons on the Playstation pad. Now the tricky part is that these symbols are written on individual cards which spin, twist and turn at different rates, so that you can never see the whole 8 symbol combination at once. Making this a game of quick reflexes. \r\n\r\nThe popcorn game: You are stuck in a square room with a popcorn machine in the middle. The object is to collect as much popcorn as possible. The machine spits out popcorn in all directions, and once the popcorn touches the floor, it's gone. When catching popcorn in mid-air by jumping towards it you get more points then by just waiting for it to drop into your beak. Sometimes there is also different colored popcorn that is shot out, which accounts for more points. And one last thing, at certain times the popcorn machine starts spinning around. When you then touch it, you also start to spin for several seconds. That wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that when you're spinning, you can't jump. Hereby adding a new tactic of trying to push you opponents against the spinning popcorn machine, while you will be able to jump over their heads gobbling up as much popcorn as possible. \r\n\r\nAnother game has you popping balloons of different colors, which are floating at various heights. These all have different point values. The longer you hold down the jump button, the higher you will be able to jump. But then again, jump too high and you will get stuck in the ceiling for a few seconds. When jumping on top of another penguins head, you also get bounced of higher, adding to the danger of getting stuck in the ceiling. \r\n\r\nAt the start of each game you are being shown which buttons on the controller must be used. \r\n\r\nThe only minigame which could be confusing without a little explanation is a memory game where the 4 penguins all stand next to each other, facing the camera. You can start by pressing any button you like. The 2nd played must repeat your command and add one of his own. The 3rd one must repeat both of these and also add one himself. This is repeated until someone can't remember all the commands or simply make a mistake. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a very fun little game, which becomes extremely enjoyable and hilarious when playing with multiple people.", "last_updated": "2018-11-04 16:51:48", "rating": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "coop": "No", "youtube": "", "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Culture Publishers"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation", "developers": null, "id": 48682, "game_title": "Nightruth: Explanation of the Paranormal - Yami no Tobira", "release_date": "1996-11-01", "platform": 10, "players": 1, "overview": "When a girl is at school in the evening, she staggers onto the road.

A PlayStation port, developed by Runecraft, was released in 2000, under the name Evo's Space Adventures. Players control Evo, a robot reduced to a crawling microchip after a ship crash, and are tasked with taking control of animals to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.\r\n\r\nThe game began development in September 1995, as part of a publishing deal with BMG Interactive. When this deal fell through, the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware also shaped the game's humour and style, with a soft focus look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models. The game's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games. Similarly, the game's music was created to resemble B movies.\r\n\r\nUpon release, Space Station Silicon Valley was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at the intuitive mechanics, innovative level design, and comical concepts.

These aliens are transported by gigantic fortresses, called in English Minecrawlers, which look like gigantic vehicles. These come to Earth with the intention of robbing us of the mineral riches and leaving this planet hollow and without any trace of life. But someone had realized long ago of the energy waves and the aliens. It was Dr. Fluke Hawkins, who before that said that there were \"Orbits of rim\" on Earth. But, when he told his colleagues this, they made fun of him and thought him crazy. So Dr. Hawkins, bored with ridicule, built a space station to live in it and never come back. But he did not go alone, he also left with his assistant (it is rumored that more than assistant, is a butler) Kurt Hectic, a young apprentice scientist and friend of Dr. Hawkins. Later, Dr. Hawkins, to not feel alone, builds a robot dog with four arms called \"Bones\" (according to the dog, it is called \"Max\"), Dr. Hawkins would never know that this dog would serve as something more than a company. The three of them spent a lot of time alone in this station in orbit to Earth, until they saw some strange energies that reached Earth. It was at this time that Dr. Hawkins discovered the energy waves. Upon learning everything about the aliens and the Minecrawlers, Dr. Hawkins gives the warning to the Earth but nobody takes him into account. After all the Minecrawlers plagued by these aliens arrived on Earth and the forces of all countries were collapsed, Dr. Hawkins decided to try to save the Earth before it was completely destroyed. His only option was his latest invention, the so-called \"ring suit\" (or in English \"ring smoking\"). This suit was a kind of modern armor, which looked like it was made of black leather. This armor had the ability to repel the bullets that would fire at it. He also brought a chain cannon with infinite ammunition that could be used as a helmet and sniper rifle, as well as a strange parachute that can be used more than once. The only one who could put on the suit was Kurt, since Dr. Hawkins is elderly and Max has four arms. Kurt did not want to go because he was afraid of dying and not seeing his friends anymore, but Dr. Hawkins convinces him after many prayers. And so begins the Mission, which is that Kurt must launch into the Minecrawler and then must infiltrate it. Here you must find the driver of the Minecrawler, but at the cost of shootings, persecutions and death duels with the aliens. By killing the driver, the entire structure begins to self-destruct and eventually sucks one of the energy waves, taking the structure, the aliens and Kurt himself. But in this journey through the waves Max takes him out before he reaches the planet of the aliens. Towards the end of the game you will not be able to escape from the wave and you will reach the alien planet.", "last_updated": "2018-07-06 22:32:55", "rating": "T - Teen", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Playmates Interactive Entertainment, Inc."], "alternates": ["Mission: Deliver Kindness"]}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation", "developers": ["Pioneer LDC"], "id": 55696, "game_title": "Serial Experiments Lain", "release_date": "1998-11-26", "platform": 10, "players": 1, "overview": "The Serial Experiments Lain video game was released for PlayStation by Pioneer LDC following the successful broadcast of the Serial Experiments Lain anime series in Japan from July to September 1998.

Commonly having neon or ultraviolet lights, extravagant paints, and shiny stainless or golden exterior parts, such decorations can be found on both on the exterior and the interior. Dekotora may be created by workers out of their work trucks for fun, or they may be designed by hobbyists for special events. They are sometimes also referred to as Art Trucks. \r\n\r\n1970s era: \r\nIn 1975, Toei released the first entry in a series of 10 movies called Torakku Yaro (Truck Guys) that featured as the protagonist a trucker who drove his garishly decorated truck all over Japan. This movie was a big hit with both old and young, and caused a wave of dekotora popularity to sweep the country. While dekotora were present throughout the 1970s, before the movie they were restricted to the north-eastern fishing transport trucks. It is possible that the movie was an attempt to popularise these kinds of trucks. In those days, ready-made parts for trucks were not easily available, so these trucks freely utilised parts from sightseeing buses or US military vehicles. \r\n\r\nModern times: \r\nSince the late 1990s, dekotora have been heavily influenced by the art of Gundam. In addition to the Gundam-influenced designs, it is common to see decorations that are more akin to modern art, or even retro designs that closely resemble those found in the movie Trucker Guys. \r\n", "last_updated": "2018-10-29 15:28:48", "rating": "T - Teen", "coop": "No", "youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dwglzXE_8A", "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Human Entertainment, Inc."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation", "developers": ["Fujimic"], "id": 60271, "game_title": "Wild Rapids", "release_date": "2000-09-30", "platform": 10, "players": 2, "overview": "In Wild Rapids there are three playable modes: tournament, time attack and vs battle.
