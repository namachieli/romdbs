It begins when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily's laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light. Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him. Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King counters and slices his body in half. Proto Man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King's plans.\r\n\r\nAfter vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to King, the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place, which confuses King. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor. When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his \"brainwashing level\" and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him. The castle begins a self-destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King.\r\n\r\nMega and Bass begin a final confrontation with Dr. Wily in his newly-regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands to know why he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities because of his past failures in challenging Mega Man. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight.

The SNES version has been recently released for download at Virtual Console. It was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force (which was now named the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R-Type Delta), the player could choose from two other Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements.\r\nIt also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if who desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.\r\nThe fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9\u00d8 Ragnar\u00f6k; it was originally referred to as 'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon. Final's version of the R-90 has the Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the R-9\u00d82 Ragnarok II has the R-90's final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be charged through 7 loops.

Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.\r\n\r\nAs is most common for the RPG genre, units become stronger by fighting enemies or by performing other actions in battle, such as healing allies. These actions give the units experience points (EXP.), which allow them to gain levels.\r\n\r\nIn Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no \"generic\" units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.\r\n\r\nEach allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.\r\n\r\nBattle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.\r\n\r\nMost games in the Shining Force series (with the exceptions of Shining Force CD, all three Game Gear games, all five cell phone games, the Shining Force III premium disc, the Shining Force for Palm Pilot game, and Shining Force Feather) also possess an exploration mode that occurs outside of battle. This gameplay mode is essentially a Japanese-style traditional RPG game, along the lines of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, although there are no labyrinths and few puzzles to solve. In this mode, the player's army is represented by Max, who is able to walk around, interact with people, find treasure, buy equipment and items, outfit the army, and choose which of the army's members will be used in battle.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:03", "rating": "T - Teen", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [451], "genres": [4, 6], "publishers": [15], "alternates": null}, {"id": 3683, "game_title": "Shining Soul", "release_date": "2003-09-16", "platform": 5, "players": 4, "overview": "Enter a world of magic and mystery, where your closest allies may sometimes turn out to be your worst enemies.

Eidos and Crystal Dynamics shaped Lara's look and movements to be an inherent extension of her skills, motivation and personality. Lara's character model features natural structure, realistic textures, detailed facial features, reactive eyes and fluid motion, all of which make her part of a living environment. New character animations and controls allow her to move through stunning environments with grace and precision, while an understanding of the game's original appeal reinvigorates the fundamental explore-and-solve adventure experience.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:32", "rating": "T - Teen", "coop": "No", "youtube": "hrFiWrB_D4s", "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [3947], "genres": [1, 2, 5, 6], "publishers": [26], "alternates": null}, {"id": 20919, "game_title": "LEGO Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge", "release_date": "2001-10-02", "platform": 5, "players": 1, "overview": "The Brickster is back and out to cause more mischief in this wild, racing, chasing, island-hopping sequel.

Rhythm Tengoku contains 48 minigames that put your rhythm to the test in a variety of crazy scenarios.\r\n\r\nRhythm Tengoku was developed by Nintendo R&D1 and released exclusively in Japan for the GBA in 2006 and in arcades with Sega's help in 2007. Being developed by the same studio responsible for the WarioWare games, Rhythm Tengoku mixes the mini-game based gameplay with rhythm game elements, featuring unusually high-quality music for a GBA game. The game started development in 2004. A 2002 prototype for a GBA drum sequencer was incorporated into Rhythm Tengoku as well: the player can freely drum within the Sound Test or take on 19 drum lessons. (Source)\r\n\r\nThe game contains eight stages with five rhythm games and one remix of the previous five each, adding up to 48 different mini-games total. Each game can be completed without hitting every note perfectly, although doing so will unlock various rhythm-related bonus games and modes, such as a drum set where you have to mimic what the drummer does.\r\n\r\nMuch like the Wario Ware series of games, Rhythm Tengoku is all about following your senses and trying to be aware of various cues in the visuals and audio. This emphasis on sense instead of language makes it quite easy for anyone to pick up and play, even though the game is entirely in Japanese (and consequently only available in the Asian region or through an import website).\r\n\r\nFor example, one of the game's levels has you rapping with a computer-controlled character. He'll speak a colour-coded Japanese phrase, and the player must press 'A' in different rhythms. Although the game explains what rhythms to do for which phrase, non-Japanese speaking players can watch hand movements on-screen to figure it out without the need for language.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, challenges will crop up, asking you to complete a level without any mistakes. Doing so earns you a certificate for that level, and a pink heart with a 'P' on it appears in that level's description.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:32", "rating": "E - Everyone", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [4397], "genres": [17], "publishers": [3], "alternates": null}, {"id": 21173, "game_title": "Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire", "release_date": "2001-09-19", "platform": 5, "players": 1, "overview": "A civilization shadowed with mystery, guarded by mythical monsters, controlled by a mighty crystal that- in the wrong hands- could destroy the legendary empire.

There are four tables for you to master, which makes for an extremely high replay value. There are also more adjustable settings than you can shake a stick at, meaning the game grows to match your skill level, as you become a more advanced player. In the unlikely event that you should conquer all four levels, try your hand at any of the 20 mini-games that are included to round out the package. Fabulous graphics and classic MUPPET humor are ever present in MUPPET PINBALL MAYHEM for the Game Boy Advance.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:34", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [2315], "genres": [11], "publishers": [133], "alternates": null}, {"id": 26055, "game_title": "The Muppets: On With the Show!", "release_date": "2003-04-05", "platform": 5, "players": null, "overview": "Help the Irresistible Muppets keep the show going, even when the rats steal the Swedish Chef's cooking ingredients, Bunsen and Beaker's experiment is out of control, and a giant Jurassic pig invades the stage!", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:34", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [9348], "genres": [1], "publishers": [463], "alternates": null}, {"id": 26056, "game_title": "NASCAR Heat 2002", "release_date": "2002-05-07", "platform": 5, "players": null, "overview": "NASCAR Heat Advance lets players strap themselves into a 750 hp stock car and enjoy all the thrills and spills of NASCAR Winston Cup Series racing anywhere.

At the core of High Heat?s gameplay was its batter-pitcher interface, which was often hailed as the most realistic of its era.[3]", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:35", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": null, "genres": [11], "publishers": null, "alternates": null}, {"id": 28158, "game_title": "Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi: Kaznapped!", "release_date": "2005-11-20", "platform": 5, "players": null, "overview": "Help Ami and Yumi track down their annoying Number One Fan, Harmony, recover their instuments and rescue their manager, Kaz.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:35", "rating": "E - Everyone", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [399], "genres": [2], "publishers": [31], "alternates": null}, {"id": 28159, "game_title": "Hugo: The Evil Mirror", "release_date": "2005-04-25", "platform": 5, "players": null, "overview": "The evil witch Scylla has trapped Hugo in a mirror, and now it's up to you to rescue him.

The core concept of ROCK \u2018EM SOCK \u2018EM ROBOTS transfers over to the GBA with no problem. Players select which of the robots they want to control and get into the ring, punching and blocking their way to victory. Gamers can practice, play a quick fight, or enter a tournament to see if they can claim the title of Rock \u2018em Sock \u2018em master. The game also features a two player mode using the Game Boy Advance Link, giving players the chance to battle their friends in much the same way they would play with the toy. This is the real joy of ROCK \u2018EM SOCK \u2018EM ROBOTS because playing against a friend really captures the feel of the classic robot battling game. Players who enjoy playing with the robot boxing toys will love ROCK \u2018EM SOCK \u2018EM ROBOTS.

The goal of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you'll be rewarded a set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them.

If you don't want to enter it, then you'll have to press B, which will repel it.

In addition, pressing the \"T\" key would cause the trousers of all three protagonists to fall down, after which they would do a double-take.

New Age Shutsudou is a semi-port/remake of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei, containing similar levels and plot to the PlayStation title. New Age Shutsudou was developed and published by Konami Corporation in 2002. The game (as well as Shin Sedai Shuumei) gives the Goemon universe a facelift. It takes place in futuristic Japan, Goemon is skinnier and sports a new hair-do, Ebisumaru is replaced with a shy girl who has a crush on Goemon named Ebisu, and Yae is replaced with Yui, a mermaid-like creature. \r\n\r\n The Impact scenes take place inside of a large mech.\r\nIn terms of gameplay, Goemon: New Age Shutsudou! is a fairly traditional side-scrolling action platformer. The player controls either Goemon or Ebisu, attacking enemies with their respective weapons (which can be leveled up three times in terms of power), and gathering coins. Each level is fairly linear in comparison to earlier Ganbare Goemon titles, and at the end of each level the player is taken to a world map. \r\n\r\nSome levels differentiate from this formula. These levels put the player in control of different characters. There are side-scrolling shoot-em-up stages starring characters like Sasuke. The weapon power-up system still works identically here, the gameplay style is just shifted. Additionally, there are stages where the player takes control of Yui, a mermaid-like creature. These stages are underwater. \r\n\r\nNew Age Shutsudou marks the return of the first person Impact scenes, which were previously in some of the Super Famicom Goemon games. These scenes put the player in control of a large mech, fighting other robots. The mech is immobile, but is able to melee attack, guard, and fire counter-attacking lasers.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:41", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [4765], "genres": [1], "publishers": [23], "alternates": null}, {"id": 46062, "game_title": "Groove Adventure Rave: Hikari to Yami no Daikessen", "release_date": "2002-03-20", "platform": 5, "players": null, "overview": "Groove Adventure Rave: Hikari to Yami no Daikessen is an Action game, published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2002.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:41", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": null, "genres": [1], "publishers": [23], "alternates": null}, {"id": 46063, "game_title": "Granbo", "release_date": "2001-12-28", "platform": 5, "players": 1, "overview": "Granbo is a Role-Playing game, published by Capcom, which was released in Japan in 2001.", "last_updated": "2018-12-27 18:00:27", "rating": "Not Rated", "coop": "No", "youtube": "", "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": null, "genres": [4], "publishers": [9], "alternates": ["Guranbo"]}, {"id": 46064, "game_title": "Gyakuten Saiban 3", "release_date": "2004-01-23", "platform": 5, "players": null, "overview": "Phoenix Wright is back as the third game in the popular Ace Attorney hand-held franchise.

Klonoa Heroes was developed by Namco and published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. Klonoa Heroes is a twist on the traditional Klonoa games, putting Klonoa in a more action role playing game along the lines of Legend of Zelda or Beyond Oasis. The game does have voice acting, as well. Kumiko Watanabe plays Klonoa, Takahiro Sakurai plays Guntz, Shouzou Iizuke plays Pango, and Yutaka Shimaka plays Garlen.\r\n\r\nKlonoa Heroes' gameplay is very similar to the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda. Players can control one of three characters (Klonoa, Guntz, and Pango) in a top-down perspective, hitting enemies with various attacks (Klonoa with the Wind Ring seen in the platforming games, albeit with a few differences). Guntz uses a handgun, while Pango throws bombs. In addition, these characters can collect more weapons as the game progresses. Every enemy in the game is given a color (either blue or red), and the player must attack that enemy with the corresponding attack (as each weapon has a blue and red attack).\r\n\r\nKlonoa Heroes also has role playing aspects. Experience points are gathered by picking up Dream Shards after defeating enemies (failure to pick them up results in no experience). Enemies also drop coins, which can be spent on items and weapons. These items can be found in chests scattered throughout the levels, as well. Most items can be used to restore health, but there are various other uses (such as stat benefits). Leveling up also allows the player to distribute points in several different areas (traditional role playing game stats, such as attack, defense, and agility). These changes are not permanent, and can be changed at any time (when not in the middle of a level).", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:41", "rating": "E - Everyone", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": null, "genres": [4], "publishers": [39], "alternates": null}, {"id": 46210, "game_title": "Koinu to Issho!

Taking place in a kingdom with tomatoes abound, the gameplay is similar to that of the Mario & Luigi series.\r\n\r\nTomato Adventure, in terms of gameplay mechanics, is the predecessor of the Mario & Luigi series of games, even having its engine reused in the first installment on the GameBoy Advance. Originally developed for the Game Boy Color, Tomato Adventure transitioned to its successor, the Game Boy Advance, when the latter was released. The main difference between the two versions is believed to lie in the quality of audio and graphics, although little substantial information exists on the Game Boy Color version.\r\n\r\nTomato Adventure incorporates a number of RPG standards such as leveling up and travelling to various places to advance the plot. However, the battle system itself is substantially different than most games in the genre, as players have a more active role in how the fights turn out. During the player's turn, they can select a character's attack and then their target. From there, they must perform one of a number of different minigames which determines how successful the attack is. These range from simple button mashers to stopping a meter at a specific point. While attacks can land without reaching the optimal point, their effectiveness tends to be severed in the process. Additionally, each attack has a separate amount of usage points which dictate how many times the player can use that specific attack before needing to revitalize themselves.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:41", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [415], "genres": [2], "publishers": [3], "alternates": null}, {"id": 46611, "game_title": "Taxi 3", "release_date": "2003-01-22", "platform": 5, "players": null, "overview": "Taxi 3 is a Racing game, developed by Visual Impact and published by Ubisoft, which was released in Europe in 2003.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:41", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [9463], "genres": [7], "publishers": [7], "alternates": null}, {"id": 46633, "game_title": "Touhai Densetsu - Akagi: Yami ni Maiorita Tensai", "release_date": "2006-03-03", "platform": 5, "players": null, "overview": "Mahjong game based on a long-running manga.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:41", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [1981], "genres": [11], "publishers": [270], "alternates": null}, {"id": 46634, "game_title": "Toukon Heat", "release_date": "2002-12-20", "platform": 5, "players": null, "overview": "Toukon Heat is a Sports game, published by Pacific Century Cyber Works, which was released in Japan in 2002.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:41", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": null, "genres": [11], "publishers": [4782], "alternates": null}, {"id": 46635, "game_title": "Toy Robo Force", "release_date": "2001-06-28", "platform": 5, "players": null, "overview": "Toy Robo Force is an Action game, developed and published by Global A, which was released in Japan in 2001.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:41", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [3502], "genres": [1], "publishers": [3290], "alternates": null}, {"id": 46636, "game_title": "Twin Series 1: Mezase Debut!
