The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-a-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the \"superteams\" with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:01", "rating": "E - Everyone", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["EA Sports"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Electronic Arts"], "id": 291, "game_title": "Madden NFL 97", "release_date": "1996-10-01", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Welcome to Madden NFL 97, the game that captures the excitement of a 30 yard touchdown pass, the strategy of a well executed scoring drive, and the atmosphere of a crisp autumn afternoon in the stadium.

Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre. Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps.

Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.

Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target.

The game might as well have been named \"inertia.\"  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.

Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer. Combat, obstacles and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks and armor. There are full race season, single race and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track's laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90\u00b0 turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.", "last_updated": "2018-07-06 22:32:55", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Interplay Entertainment Corp."], "alternates": ["Radical Psycho Machine Racing"]}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Squaresoft"], "id": 5819, "game_title": "Treasure of the Rudras", "release_date": "1996-04-05", "platform": 6, "players": 1, "overview": "The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear.

The game was originally targeted to pre-teen and younger teenage girls, but became unexpectedly popular with older teenagers and women in their 20s. Angelique is credited with \"set[ing] up the speci?cs and conventions of women\u2019s games: a focus on romance, easy controls and utilizing other multimedia.\" In 2002, Konami released its very successful Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side, which brought many new fans to the still-new genre. In 2006, Famitsu's listings for the Top 20 selling love games included seven otome games. Early games borrowed heavily from the iconography and story conventions of \"retro shoujo manga\", \"the archetypical girly heroines, the emphasis on pure, sexless, tranquil romance and on a peaceful, stable setting\", but as the category expanded, other narrative and gameplay elements were introduced, including action/adventure, combat and plots in which \"the heroine can \u2018save the world\u2019 and \u2018get the guy\u2019 at the same time\".\r\n\r\nCommercially available English-developed otome games in modern times include Date Warp, Fatal Hearts, and Heileen.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\r\n\r\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\r\n\r\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.\r\n\r\nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:26", "rating": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Role-Playing", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Squaresoft"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Universal Co., Ltd."], "id": 9247, "game_title": "Mr. Do!", "release_date": "1996-12-01", "platform": 6, "players": 2, "overview": "You control Mr. Do has he tries to harvest all of the cherries on the screen.

It was ported to Nintendo Super Famicom in 1992.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2100, the Earth's environment is devastated by its inhabitants, who develop their space technology to live on Mars. Before they left, the humans created a Bio-Computer assigned to replenish Earth's ecosystem in hopes of returning to Earth. 50 years after terra-forming parts of Mars, the human colonists were attacked by mysterious, but hostile UFOs. The military leaders among the colonists set up an attack force to defend the colonists using state of the art fighter ships identified as the Icarus. The main operation of attack is called \"Acrobat Mission\" because it exceeds the technical flying ability of the pilots.\r\nIn the arcade version, surviving fighter pilots Jet and Nova are available for the player to choose for the rest of the game, but both were discluded from the Super Famicom port, making the player's pilot anonymous as well as discarding Nova's custom color scheme.\r\nHere however is the story, exactly as it appears at the beginning of the game, with spelling and grammar mistakes preserved:\r\n\"AD 2100: HUMANS EXTERMINATED BY THEIR OWN NATURE DISTRUPTION AND ESCAPE TO MARS LEAVING BIO-COMPUTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RECUPERATION OF EARTH. ONE DAY HALF A CENTURY AFTER HUMANS ARRIVED, MARS WAS ATTACKED BY STRANGE FLYING OBJECTES. TO FIGHT THESE ENEMIES, THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEFENCE AGENCY ORGANIZED THE TASK FORCE ARMY AND STARTED THE DOG FIGHT WITH INVADERS QUICLY. THE OPERATION WAS CALLED \"ACROBAT MISSION\" AS IT EXCEEDED THE PILOT'S TECHNICAL LIMIT.\"\r\n\r\nPlayers started the game equipped with the default weapon, the Standard Shot: a semi-automatic laser weapon. Though moderately powerful, the Standard Shot cannot be upgraded or charged. Once the player has lost a significant number of lives and their selected weapon his lost its upgrades, the Standard Shot will once again take over.\r\nTwo other weapons are selectable to the player, one of which is the Wave Shot (announced as Wide in the Arcade version). The Wave Shot is a spread shot that increases in size, numbers and strength. When charged, the Wave Shot can unleash a short range, but powerful laser blast that increases in width and strength when Wave icons are collected. The other weapon was the Hurricane Shot, a unique area-effect weapon that encircles the ship clockwise when fired before flying forward. When charged, the Hurricane Shot fires a ball of energy across the screen, but there is a one second delay every time the shot is fired.\r\nThe player also had Bombs although unlike many shooters, the player can only hold up to two bombs. Once collected however, the two bombs get physically mounted under the ship's wings. If an enemy shot hits one of the bombs, then the bomb will detonate, creating a destructive shield for the player. The player can manually detonate either bomb at will.\r\nThe player's Icarus fighter ship has a number of defenses at its disposal as well. Whenever the player moves their ship in any given direction, a burst of flame from the ship's jet exhaust will shoot out from the opposite direction the player moves the ship in. This applies to all directions: left, right, front, back and all four diagonal angles. This jet exhaust not only serves an aesthetic purpose, but it can also harm nearby enemies and destroy nearby objects.\r\nWhenever the player is hit, their ship will steer wildly out of control. Once this happens, a timer will appear near the ship which indicates how long the ship has until it explodes. The explosion of the player's ship will harm any nearby enemies. Also, because the Icarus is apparently well built, any kamikaze enemies or drifting objects that touch it will not damage or destroy the player's ship, allowing the player less restrictive movement.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:30", "rating": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Teichiku Co., LTD."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Chunsoft"], "id": 19047, "game_title": "Dragon Quest I & II", "release_date": "1993-12-18", "platform": 6, "players": 1, "overview": "Remakes of the two first Dragon Quest for Famicom realized for the Super Famicom.\r\nThis remake includes updated graphics that retain the original look, sound of higher quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world: certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as \"Stairs\") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.\r\nFamitsu gave the SNES compilation remake Dragon Quest I + II a rating of 35 out of 40", "last_updated": "2018-12-17 19:23:16", "rating": "Not Rated", "coop": "No", "youtube": "", "genres": ["Role-Playing"], "publishers": ["Enix Corporation"], "alternates": ["Dragon Quest 1+2", "Dragon Quest I+II", "Dragon Quest I.II"]}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Alfa System"], "id": 19069, "game_title": "Emerald Dragon", "release_date": "1995-07-28", "platform": 6, "players": 1, "overview": "Emerald Dragon is a Role-Playing game, developed by Alfa System and published by Media Works, which was released in Japan in 1995.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:31", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Role-Playing"], "publishers": ["Media Works Inc."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Dynamite"], "id": 19112, "game_title": "Adventures of Hourai High", "release_date": "1996-04-19", "platform": 6, "players": 1, "overview": "You assume the role of a student (whose gender you can choose) still aboard the flight towards the fictional Utsuho Island of Southern Japan, the location of the strangest school of the country: Hourai High School.

It\u00b4s got everything about the original Cyber Knight that was refreshing and nifty, cleans up the spotty bits that were a little aggravating, and improves on the forumla ten times over.

Even if you didn\u00b4t like the original Cyber Knight, chances are you\u00b4ll love this one. The story\u00b4s better, there\u00b4s an autobattle, there are even more neoparts, the star map interface is greatly improved, your \"inactive\" characters are automatically relegated to Support Modules and are able to not only gain combat experience but also use their skills and sometimes even finish battles before they even begin...

Eight different players can become the captain of the player's team and the team can use one of five different formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero). All of the formations are used in modern day soccer except for the WM formation (which saw common use in England during the 1930s). The star player (captain) chosen kicks a shot (super shot or hyper shot) that pushes the goalkeeper into the stands, just like in Hat Trick Hero. Exhibition, world league (similar to a World Cup tournament) and Taito Cup (24 teams to beat) are the three possible variations in the game.

Takahashi (Gasaraki). Together they created one of the most beloved (in Japan) shows in the history of Japanese Animation. The series was later released (1996) in the US by Central Park Media. The series spanned 19 videocassettes, and quickly developed a small, but devoted fan following. Its 80's style animation turned off a lot of would-be fans, but those willing to endure the animation were rewarded with one of the best storylines (and also some really cool mecha designs) available in the genre.

Rather than clearing all the blocks on the screen, which is common for other games of this type, the player only has to remove the yellow balls wearing shades to clear a level. They will receive a bonus for clearing the screen, however.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, items will drop from the destroyed blocks. These include extending and shrinking the paddle, adding more balls, extra lives and power stars. By collecting power stars, the player can increase the strength that the ball leaves the paddle, causing more damage to blocks.

Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him. Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King counters and slices his body in half. Proto Man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King's plans.\r\n\r\nAfter vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to King, the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place, which confuses King. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor. When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his \"brainwashing level\" and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him. The castle begins a self-destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King.\r\n\r\nMega and Bass begin a final confrontation with Dr. Wily in his newly-regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands to know why he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities because of his past failures in challenging Mega Man. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight.

It was designed by Toru Iwatani, who had also designed the Gee Bee series, Pac-Man, and Pole Position. It is a curious but challenging game, where the player tries to harvest little mushrooms (Mushlins) while avoiding various enemies, and was the first game from Namco to use a Motorola 68000 processor (which ran at 6.144 MHz).\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two \"arrows\", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a \"season\" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, various enemies will appear and try to stop the player. The most common are four little hooded critters (Hobblins), which start each season in the corners. If the player catches them in a loop, they will be sent to the top of the screen for a short period of time. Other critters such as fireballs (Killers), sparks (Changers), and Demons will also appear. These can be killed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies (Shears) appear, and if they cross the player's line, they cut it. If the player's line is ever cut by Shears or Demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows.\r\n\r\nEvery so often when the player closes a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area he or she has closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, the player must surround a small enough area which covers just the chest, and no other possible hiding places. The game guides the player along that step, first by challenging him or her to uncover a chest at the start of the game (and then by revealing the locations of the chests for the first two seasons). When the player actually uncovers a chest, six bonus creatures (Topcups) will pop out, then make for the edges. The player must corral them with his or her line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If the player manages to complete a bonus word, the season is automatically cleared out and the player moves to a bonus stage where he or she must try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, the player needs to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit.\r\n\r\nThe player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or she runs out of time (the border is the player's timer, and he or she can boost the time by looping Mushlins and plants), and the player gains an extra life at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points by default. After the 100th season, the season counter will stop at 99, similar to how Galaxian and King & Balloon's round indicators would stop after 48 rounds.", "last_updated": "2018-07-17 04:02:05", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Namco"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Advance Communication Company"], "id": 38967, "game_title": "Light Fantasy", "release_date": "1992-07-03", "platform": 6, "players": 1, "overview": "Light Fantasy (\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fc?) is a 1992 video game for the Super Famicom that was released exclusively in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe story is about raising a weak hero to be an independent man in a role-playing game with a heart-warming atmosphere.

Logos Panic pits players to scramble Japanese Kanji in a sort of Tetris puzzle style scenario; kanji must be correctly put together in time, simultaneously as new kanji pop out at the bottom of the screen. The game ends when the player can't assemble appropriate sentences in time.

The player emerges in the middle of Tokyo's Akihabara district where the buildings have turned into ruins. Countless demons have managed to destroy cities everywhere and the people are all hiding underground. Getting home to the Shinjuku district will allow the player to uncover more of the plot. Mysterious artificats called ooparts (out-of-place artifacts) help to play a role in this invasion by a mysterious civilization.\r\n\r\nPlayers must choose between five characters; each one having different strengths and limitations. The game is played from the first-person perspective and the battles are extremely random. The dungeons in the game are claustrophobic and should remind some games of Shin Megami Tensei. Players do not gain levels after earning so many experience points.

Designer Toshio Iwai was inspired by his earlier interactive installation art piece titled Music Insects, to develop a video game at Nintendo between 1993 and late 1994. The completed product was inexplicably canceled by Nintendo, and the game's key elements were later developed into Maxis's 1996 PC game release titled SimTunes.\r\n\r\nSound Fantasy contains eccentric concepts and untested game mechanics. Music games, especially on home consoles, were not popular in the early 1990s, and it wouldn't be until much later in the decade that they gained mainstream attention.[citation needed] The Sound Fantasy prototype contains four different games in one cartridge.\r\n\r\nPix Quartet was inspired by Toshio Iwai's Music Insects. There are four insects of different colors, where the player can select different insect to each represent a different instrument. They crawl all over the screen, where the player can draw. Insects that crawl over a colored pixel make a note. Each color represents a different note for each insects. Sample Demos can be loaded to demonstrate the capabilities of this game.\r\n\r\nBeat Hopper contains three different modes: A-type, B-type and Training. A-type is a rhythm game in the style of Q-bert, where an insect on a pogo must make every block disappear after stepping on it as many times needed. Each block makes its own sound and the order does not matter. The player can improvise a song with each block. B-type requires the player to follow a path of blocks that appears every time the player touches one. The player must make as many steps as possible without losing three lives.\r\n\r\nIce Sweeper indicates two modes: A-type and B-type. This game is a Breakout clone with a few new twists added after a few stages, such as four bats controlled by a single player.\r\n\r\nStar Fly is inspired by music boxes, where the player can set a sequence of stars in the sky, to compose a song. A higher star corresponds to a higher musical note. The player may set the speed and the tone.", "last_updated": "2018-07-17 03:58:29", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Music"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Success Corp."], "id": 39923, "game_title": "Sound Novel Tsukuru", "release_date": "1996-05-31", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Sound Novel Tsukuru is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Success and published by ASCII Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1996.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Role-Playing"], "publishers": ["ASCII Entertainment Software, Inc."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": null, "id": 39924, "game_title": "Spark World", "release_date": "1995-05-26", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Spark World is an Action game, published by Den'Z, which was released in Japan in 1995.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Den'Z"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Vap"], "id": 39925, "game_title": "Sprinter Monogatari", "release_date": "1995-03-17", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Sprinter Monogatari is a Sports game, developed and published by Vap, which was released in Japan in 1995.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Vap Inc."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": null, "id": 39926, "game_title": "St Andrews: Eikou to Rekishi no Old Course", "release_date": "1995-09-15", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "St Andrews: Eikou to Rekishi no Old Course is a Sports game, published by Epoch, which was released in Japan in 1995.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Epoch Co., Ltd."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka"], "id": 39927, "game_title": "Jikkyou Keiba Simulation: Stable Star", "release_date": "1996-03-22", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Jikkyou Keiba Simulation: Stable Star is a Sports game, developed by KCEO and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1996.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Sunsoft"], "id": 39929, "game_title": "Sugoi Hebereke", "release_date": "1994-03-11", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Sugoi Hebereke (\u3059\u3054\u3044\u3078\u3079\u308c\u3051 lit. \"Amazing Hebereke\"?) is a 1994 fighting game developed and published by Sunsoft exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom on March 11, 1994.

It was succeeded by Super Nazo Puyo Tsu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki. A Nuisance Puyo variation known as Iron Puyo was introduced in this game.\r\n\r\nSuper Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux uses the basic rules of Puyo Puyo. The game controls like a normal Puyo Puyo game with all five colors available and the ability to roate clockwise and counter clockwise, except the ability to double rotate and climb is not possible. Each puzzle gives the player different objectives to clear. The objectives range from clearing all of a specific color of Puyo, clearing all Nuisance Puyo, creating a specific chain length, clearing a certain amount of Puyo simultaneously, or simply clear the whole board. Every time the player fails to complete a puzzle, the player's health will deplete, as indicated by Arle or Rulue's expression gradually getting more distressed. If the player's health depletes completely, they'll receive a Game Over and can either choose to continue from the last save or quit back to the title. The player can recover completely if the gauges on the right side of the screen fills completely and rank up, with each cleared puzzle filling it gradually. On the pause menu, the player has the option to skip a puzzle at the cost of health.\r\n\r\nThere are five game modes: Arle's Roux, Rulue's Roux, Road to Chains, Endless Puyo, and Editor. In the first three modes, the player must solve the presented tasks with a set of available Puyo. Arle's Roux focuses on a scenario with Arle, acting as the normal course with her puzzles only involving standard Puyo. Rulue's Roux is the mode that focuses on Rulue and acts as the expert mode, with her puzzles including Iron Puyo and Blocks. In both modes, the objective is to clear puzzle sets from varies characters within an area, with one character acting as a boss that cannot be challenged until the others are beaten. Once the boss of a given area is beaten, the player will progress to the next area. Road to Chains acts as a challenge mode where the player is given a series of puzzles to solve at a gradually increasing difficulty, with the player being unable to restore health.\r\n\r\nThe Endless Puyo mode is a regular endless mode except that 6 next Puyo are shown instead of 1 next Puyo, and that nuisance Puyo will fall in the higher levels of difficulty. The Editor mode allows you to place Puyo freely in a manner similar to Practice Notebook in Puyo Puyo 7. You can also set a list of next Puyo and the task to be solved.", "last_updated": "2018-07-17 04:02:05", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Banpresto Co., Ltd."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Compile"], "id": 40067, "game_title": "Super Nazo Puyo Tsuu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjyouki", "release_date": "1996-06-28", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Super Nazo Puyo Tsuu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjyouki is a Puzzle game, developed and published by Compile, which was released in Japan in 1996.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Compile"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": null, "id": 40068, "game_title": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong", "release_date": "1992-12-18", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong is a Miscellaneous game, published by Nichibutsu, which was released in Japan in 1992.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Nichibutsu"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": ["Nichibutsu"], "id": 40069, "game_title": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 2: Zenkoku Seiha Hen", "release_date": "1993-10-29", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 2: Zenkoku Seiha Hen is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Nichibutsu, which was released in Japan in 1993.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Nichibutsu"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": null, "id": 40070, "game_title": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 3: Yoshimoto Gekijou Hen", "release_date": "1994-07-29", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 3: Yoshimoto Gekijou Hen is a Miscellaneous game, published by Nichibutsu, which was released in Japan in 1994.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Nichibutsu"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": null, "id": 40071, "game_title": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 4: Kiso Kenkyu Hen", "release_date": "1996-09-27", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 4: Kiso Kenkyu Hen is a Miscellaneous game, published by Nichibutsu, which was released in Japan in 1996.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Nichibutsu"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "developers": null, "id": 40072, "game_title": "Super Okuman Chouja Game", "release_date": "1995-11-24", "platform": 6, "players": null, "overview": "Super Okuman Chouja Game (\"Super Billionaire Game\") is a multiplayer virtual board game that concerns commerce and property development, not unlike Monopoly.

It was developed and published by Konami, and was released exclusively in Japan in 1994, for the Super Famicom.\r\n\r\nIt features the cast of the manga and anime Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai (usually localized as \"Hang in There, Tsuyoshi\") and Konami's own spin on Puyo Puyo: Taisen Puzzle-Dama (\"Battle Puzzle Ball\"). The goal of the game is to compete with a series of characters from Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai depending on who the player selected.\r\n\r\nPlay involves stacking duos of faces of various colors. If the player completes a set of three faces - they don't have to be lined up, but they do need to be adjacent - the faces disappear. If they are next to a \"trapped\" face it is transformed into a normal face block.
