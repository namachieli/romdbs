Saucer-shaped UFOs and guided missiles occasionally appear for a bonus opportunity. The saucers differ from the tanks in that they do not fire upon the player, and do not appear on radar. The player can hide behind the solids or maneuver in rapid turns once fired on to buy time with which to fire himself. Common play in the US could run from 25 cents to a dollar per game, depending on machine setting. The typical setting is for 25 cent play, with three tanks.\r\n\r\nA standard enemy tank is worth 1,000 points, a supertank 3,000 points, and the flying saucer 5,000 points. The guided missile is worth 2,000 points when destroyed. Each of these targets can be destroyed with a single shot from the player's tank. An extra life is awarded when the player's score reaches 15,000 points, and a further tank is then awarded at 100,000 points. No additional tanks are awarded until the score counter rolls over at ten million, and additional bonus tanks are again awarded at indicated scores of 15,000 and 100,000.

If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time.

Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a \"wall\" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.\r\n\r\nThe game also includes a Puzzle mode.

It is regarded as a classic from the golden age of video arcade games, noted for its novel gameplay and theme. The object of the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full of hazards. The Frogger coin-op is an early example of a game with more than one CPU, as it used two Z80 processors.[4]\r\n\r\nBy 2005, Frogger in its various home video game incarnations had sold 20 million copies worldwide, including 5 million in the United States.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game starts with three, five, or seven frogs (lives), depending on the settings used by the operator. The player guides a frog which starts at the bottom of the screen, to his home in one of 5 slots at the top of the screen. The lower half of the screen contains a road with motor vehicles, which in various versions include cars, trucks, buses, dune buggies, bulldozers, vans, taxis, bicyclists, and/or motorcycles, speeding along it horizontally. The upper half of the screen consists of a river with logs, alligators, and turtles, all moving horizontally across the screen. The very top of the screen contains five \"frog homes\" which are the destinations for each frog. Every level is timed; the player must act quickly to finish each level before the time expires.\r\n\r\nThe only player control is the 4 direction joystick used to navigate the frog; each push in a direction causes the frog to hop once in that direction. On the bottom half of the screen, the player must successfully guide the frog between opposing lanes of trucks, cars, and other vehicles, to avoid becoming roadkill.\r\n\r\nThe middle of the screen, after the road, contains a median where the player must prepare to navigate the river.\r\n\r\nBy jumping on swiftly moving logs and the backs of turtles and alligators except the alligator jaws, the player can guide his or her frog safely to one of the empty lily pads. The player must avoid alligators sticking out at one of the five \"frog homes\", snakes, and otters in the river, but may catch bugs or escort a lady frog for bonuses. When all five frogs are directed home, the game progresses to the next level, with increased difficulty. After five levels, the game gets briefly easier yet again gets progressively harder to the next fifth level.\r\n\r\nSoftline in 1982 stated that \"Frogger has earned the ominous distinction of being 'the arcade game with the most ways to die'\".[6] There are many different ways to lose a life (illustrated by a \"skull and crossbones\" symbol where the frog was), including:\r\n\r\nBeing hit by or running into a road vehicle\r\nJumping into the river's water\r\nRunning into snakes, otters or into an alligator's jaws in the river\r\nJumping into a home invaded by an alligator\r\nStaying on top of a diving turtle until it has completely submerged\r\nRiding a log, alligator, or turtle off the side of the screen\r\nJumping into a home already occupied by a frog\r\nJumping into the side of a home or the bush\r\nRunning out of time\r\nFrogger is available as a standard upright or cocktail cabinet. The controls consist solely of a 4-direction joystick used to guide the frog's jump direction. The number of simultaneous players is one, and the game has a maximum of two players.\r\n\r\nThe game's opening tune is the first verse of a Japanese children's song called Inu No Omawarisan (The Dog Policeman). The song remained intact in the US release. Other Japanese tunes that are played during gameplay include the themes to the anime Hana no Ko Lunlun and Araiguma Rascal.", "last_updated": "2018-07-17 03:58:28", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [5706], "genres": null, "publishers": [201], "alternates": null}, {"id": 24079, "game_title": "Franky, Joe & Dirk...

As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.\r\n\r\nWhile the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.\r\n\r\nThe twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:33", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [7395], "genres": [1], "publishers": [155], "alternates": null}, {"id": 24087, "game_title": "Lingo", "release_date": "1994-01-01", "platform": 4, "players": 1, "overview": "Lingo is a Miscellaneous game, developed by PCSL and published by Altron, which was released in Europe in 1994.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:33", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [6492], "genres": [5], "publishers": [1526], "alternates": null}, {"id": 24088, "game_title": "Lucky Luke", "release_date": "1996-01-01", "platform": 4, "players": 1, "overview": "Lucky Luke is an Action game, developed by Bit Managers and published by Infogrames, which was released in Europe in 1996.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:33", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [1097], "genres": [15], "publishers": [72], "alternates": null}, {"id": 24089, "game_title": "Lucle", "release_date": "1994-01-01", "platform": 4, "players": 1, "overview": "Lucle is a Puzzle game, developed and published by Vic Tokai, which was released in Japan in 1994.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:33", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [9344], "genres": [5], "publishers": [2610], "alternates": null}, {"id": 24090, "game_title": "Magnetic Soccer", "release_date": "1992-01-01", "platform": 4, "players": 2, "overview": "Each team has eight players (one goalkeeper, two attackers/defenders, and three midfielders).

In the base world, three kings named Armor, Sword, and Shield fight for dominance using a piece of legendary equipment corresponding to their names. Visiting King Armor, the party learns that he is in love with a girl who returns his feelings, but cannot marry him, as a bandit holds her village hostage in return for her love. They defeat the bandit, and the king gives them his armor in gratitude. King Sword attacks the heroes, who vanquish him and take the sword. Lastly, King Shield is murdered by his own steward, and after a short fight, the party recovers his shield. Restoring the items to a statue of a great hero, they receive the Black Sphere, but are attacked by Gen-bu, the first of four fiends controlled by Ashura. They defeat him and use the power of the Sphere to enter the tower.\r\n\r\nThey climb the tower and come to another door; inside lies a second world surrounded by large bodies of water. By navigating caves, they find a floating island which allows them to travel around the world by air. They locate an old man, Ryu-O, and solve his riddle to obtain the Airseed, allowing them to breathe underwater and enter the undersea palace. They encounter the second fiend, Sei-ryu; they defeat him and recover half of the second sphere. Upon returning to Ryu-O, he reveals himself to be the guardian of the other half of the sphere, and the two halves form the Blue Sphere.\r\n\r\nUsing the Blue Sphere to continue up the tower, the party comes to a world of clouds, dominated by Byak-ko and an army of thugs. They learn that Byak-ko recently wiped out an underground resistance movement, except for Millie and Jeanne, the two daughters of its leader. The party temporarily joins Byak-ko's gang to find the girls, and attempt to defend them until Millie betrays Jeanne and the party is captured. Breaking free, they confront the fiend, who tries to kill Millie; Jeanne takes the blow and the party engages the fiend. They defeat him, recover the White Sphere, and continue their journey.\r\n\r\nThe fourth world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland; Su-Zaku roams the surface defended by an impenetrable forcefield. The party retreats to an abandoned subway for refuge and meets Sayaka, who directs them to the nearest town. There the party is confronted by the leader of a biker gang, So-Cho, but his sister Sayaka intervenes and the two groups agree to work together to defeat Su-Zaku. As they gather the needed parts for a device to deactivate the forcefield, So-Cho sacrifices his life to guide the party through an atomic power plant. Beasts then ambush the town, and Su-Zaku kidnaps Sayaka. The party defeats Su-Zaku, earns the Red Sphere and travels on.\r\n\r\nClimbing the tower, the party discovers the remains of a family that attempted to reach Paradise but failed, and a library suggesting Ashura is controlled by someone else. They encounter him at the top, guarding the final door; he offers each of them control of one of the worlds, but they refuse and defeat him. Before they can pass through the door, a trap drops them to the bottom floor. Encountering the allies they made along their journey, they decide to rescale the tower. As they climb stairs that wrap outside of the tower, they engage each of the fiends revived and defeat them. They find the Creator at the summit, and learn that the fiends and the tower itself are actually part of a game created by him to see heroes defeat evil; for succeeding they would be granted a wish as a reward. Angry at his manipulation, they reject the reward and challenge the Creator, who insists that because he created everything he was allowed to use them as he saw fit. They then attack and defeat the Creator in a fierce battle.

One day, the Hero's friend informs him of the Dark Lord's goals, and he urges him to seek a Knight named Bogard. As the Hero escapes imprisonment, he learns that the Dark Lord is seeking a key to the Mana Sanctuary in order to control the Mana Tree, an energy source that sustains life. The Hero is befriended by the Heroine (named by the player) who is also seeking Bogard. The two find Bogard, who recommends that they seek out a man named Cibba. During their journey to meet Cibba, the Heroine is kidnapped. With the aid of a mysterious man, she is later rescued by the Hero. When they meet Cibba, he plays a message left by the Heroine's mother, who reveals that she is a descendant of the guardians of the Mana Tree and that her pendant is the key to it. The mysterious man, upon discovering that the heroine holds the pendant, reveals himself to be Julius, the Dark Lord's advisor, and kidnaps her. The Hero then attempts to rescue the Heroine, but he fails and is knocked off of Julius's airship. However, the Heroine gives the Hero the pendant just before he falls.\r\n\r\nThe Hero is then reunited with Amanda, an escapee from his prison, who steals the pendant in order to win her brother Lester's freedom. The mayor of Jadd, Davias, takes the pendant, but he transforms Lester into a parrot. The Hero and Amanda confront a Medusa for its tear, which will break the spell. They kill it, but Amanda is infected by the Medusa's attack, causing her to transform into one herself. The Hero reluctantly kills her, and uses her tears to break Lester's spell. Lester avenges Amanda's death by killing Davias, who reveals that he gave the pendant to the Dark Lord. The Hero confronts and defeats the Dark Lord; however, Hero discovers that the Heroine is under Julius' mind control and has opened the entrance to the Mana Tree. Julius reveals he is the last survivor of the Vandole empire, the empire who attempted to control the Mana Tree years ago, and handily defeats the Hero.\r\n\r\nRealizing he is powerless to defeat Julius, the Hero learns from Cibba about a powerful sword called Excalibur. Cibba helps him find the Excalibur only to find a rusty Sword instead. He explains that the rusty sword is the Excalibur and would reveal its true strength to whoever it finds worthy. The Hero then raises Dime Tower to reach the Mana Sanctuary and meets a robot known as Marcie. After reaching the top, the tower begins to collapse and Marcie sacrifices himself by throwing the Hero across. After obtaining and passing the sword's trials, the Hero confronts and defeats Julius at the cost of the Mana Tree's life. The Heroine's mother reveals she is the current Mana Tree and before dying, asks the Heroine to succeed her position. The Heroine agrees and bids farewell to the Hero as she becomes the next Mana Tree and the Hero her guardian.", "last_updated": "2018-07-06 22:32:55", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [8096], "genres": [2, 4], "publishers": [11], "alternates": ["Final Fantasy Adventure", "Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden"]}, {"id": 52984, "game_title": "Yuu Yuu Hakusho", "release_date": "1993-07-23", "platform": 4, "players": 1, "overview": "Yuu Yuu Hakusho is an Action game, developed and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1993.", "last_updated": "2018-08-22 18:33:41", "rating": "Not Rated", "coop": "No", "youtube": "", "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": null, "genres": [1], "publishers": [780], "alternates": null}, {"id": 52985, "game_title": "Yu Yu Hakusho Dai-Ni-Dan: Ankoku Bujutsu Kai Hen", "release_date": "1993-12-10", "platform": 4, "players": 1, "overview": "Yuu Yuu Hakusho Dai-Ni-Tama is an Action game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1993.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:43", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": null, "genres": [10], "publishers": [780], "alternates": null}, {"id": 52986, "game_title": "Yuu Yuu Hakusho Dai-San-Tama", "release_date": "1994-06-03", "platform": 4, "players": 1, "overview": "Yuu Yuu Hakusho Dai-San-Tama is an Action game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1994.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:43", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": [8932], "genres": [1], "publishers": [780], "alternates": null}, {"id": 52987, "game_title": "Yu Yu Hakusho Dai-Yon-Dan: Makai Toitsu Hen", "release_date": "1994-12-09", "platform": 4, "players": 1, "overview": "Yuu Yuu Hakusho Dai 4 Tama: Makai Touitsu is an Action game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1994.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:43", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "os": null, "processor": null, "ram": null, "hdd": null, "video": null, "sound": null, "developers": null, "genres": [10], "publishers": [780], "alternates": null}, {"id": 52988, "game_title": "Bomberman GB 2", "release_date": "1995-01-01", "platform": 4, "players": 1, "overview": "Bomberman GB 2 (known simply as Bomberman GB outside Japan) is a game for the original Game Boy and was released in North America in April of 1998.
