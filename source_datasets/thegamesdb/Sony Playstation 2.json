Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered I.S.A. forces.\r\nIn the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their human cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast and trained troopers, they require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to that found on the planet Helghan.\r\nThe player takes control of I.S.A.

The Earth Defense Fleet (EDF) go to assist the Vektan Army, however Adams kills General Voughton and receives his security key, allowing him to reboot the platforms, and prepare an ambush for the EDF relief force.\r\nJan and the others confront Lente, only to find out that Hakha was a commander in chief for him. Lente says that Hakha's family was ashamed to even be related to him, except his brother who talked of his heroism. Because of this, Lente had Hakha's brother shot down. With anger in his eyes, Hakha shoots Lente dead.\r\nThe team fly to the central SD platform and confront Adams, who is wounded by Templar.

The Prize can be the 3rd prize Fan ID, the 2nd prize Fan letter, or the 1st prize present which could be a new summoning, gadget, vehicle, or clothing. The Gadget could be fiery, electrical, or icy and the vehicle can only be icy.\r\n\r\nThe Summonings are monkeys, that you gain by getting fan prizes, are used to help you win Levels where you're on foot. They can do things like heal you, cause a sandstorm, attack the opponent directly, etc. Each summoning can only do one thing and you can only have one summoning. Not all summoning came from previous games but two summoning came from the Freaky Monkey Five!\r\n\r\nAfter the Subfinals you may use specials by combining buttons next to each other. Each Characters have different specials. For example, The regular Pipo monkey's strongest special is the RC car and the Stunclub combined and it causes you to throw a banana straight forward, and if it hits an enemy then several monkeys jump out of nowhere and beat up the enemy senseless. It won't always KO in one hit.\r\n\r\nYou also can fight each other in story mode. There are many place to fight. You can use 5 types of cool gadgets.

After unwittingly releasing the Darkwatch's greatest enemy, a vampire lord named Lazarus Malkoth, Jericho is conscripted into the Darkwatch as an elite operative. Jericho, however, is slowly turning into a vampire himself, after being bitten by Lazarus. The game outlines either Jericho's struggle for humanity or his descent into darkness, depending on the player's actions.\r\n\r\nThe game begins in Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho attempting to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game, and in doing so releases Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him the curse of the vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Cassidy as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse.\r\n\r\nAs the game progresses, Jericho finally makes his way to the Darkwatch Citadel, where he meets General Clay Cartwright, the current leader of the order. Cartwright puts him through Torture Maze, the Darkwatch initiation exercise which was designed as a test for Darkwatch Regulators, but Jericho gets a special version specially designed by Cartwright to kill him. When Jericho passes the test anyway, he begins to do missions for the Darkwatch. Missions include tasks ranging from fixing some of the damage he has caused to acquiring Darkwatch equipment, such as the Darklight Prism, a stone that allows vampires within its vicinity to use their powers and walk in sunlight. On some of his missions Jericho is accompanied by other Darkwatch forces including his new partner, a sultry and vicious temptress named Tala. Eventually, during their night of passion, Tala causes him to bite her and inherits some portion of his power, transforming herself into a half-vampire creature similar to him. She then betrays the Darkwatch from within, allowing the undead hordes to invade its headquarters.\r\n\r\nA final showdown ensues with Lazarus, in which Jericho arises victorious, and a choice is given for him to side with either Cassidy or Tala. Either Jericho rids the west of the Curse of Lazarus, or he becomes the Curse; the player's choice determines how the game ends. If the character were to choose the good option, then the final fight will be against the vampiric Tala, and if they player chose to take Lazarus' curse for himself, then he must fight the ghost of Cassidy. The bad ending shows the now-monstrous Jericho killing Tala and riding into the night, while the good ending shows Cassidy's soul being released.", "last_updated": "2018-08-15 18:15:00", "rating": "M - Mature", "coop": "Yes", "youtube": "qNsBVvVsY3o", "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation 2", "developers": ["WideScreen Games"], "id": 7203, "game_title": "Dead to Rights II", "release_date": "2005-04-12", "platform": 11, "players": 1, "overview": "Dead to Rights II marks the return of action-hero Jack Slate and his K-9 companion, Shadow.

The only one left unaffected is the unnamed protagonist, a Trodain guard. The guard, King Trode, and Princess Medea set out on a quest to track down Dhoulmagus and break the spell. They are joined by Yangus, a bandit whose life the hero saves from a collapsing bridge; Jessica, a mage seeking to avenge her brother; and Angelo, a Templar Knight with a penchant for flirting and gambling. Tracking Dhoulmagus' murderous path, the party journeys west, across the ocean. Eventually, the group hunts down Dhoulmagus and kills him, but Dhoulmagus' death fails to break the spell. Jessica claims Dhoulmagus' scepter, and soon after disappears.\r\n\r\nJessica later returns, possessed by the staff and battles the remaining party members in an attempt to murder a young man. After the party releases Jessica from her possession, Jessica tells them that the scepter contains the spirit of Rhapthorne, the Lord of Darkness, who was imprisoned in the scepter long ago by seven sages. He seeks to escape from his prison by killing the descendants of the sages. When Jessica explains this, the scepter takes control of a magician\u2019s dog, Sir Leopold, and kills the magician\u2019s assistant, who was one of the descendants of the sages. The party attempts to seek out and defend the remaining descendants, but Leopold manages to murder most of them, until the scepter comes into the possession of Marcello, Angelo's power hungry half-brother. Marcello kills the last remaining descendant of the sages, but manages to contain Rhapthorne for a time. Eventually, the party engages Marcello for murdering a High priest, expending Marcello's energy and releasing Rhapthorne. The party, aided by the godbird Empryea, faces Rhapthorne and defeats him. With Rhapthorne dead, King Trode, Princess Medea, and the people of Trodain are returned to normal.

Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...\r\n\r\nThe player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.\r\n\r\nLevels that have been visited before might become \"Expedition Missions\" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons.

Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough.\r\n\r\nThese trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm. Their amulet position also dictates the effectiveness of their elemental powers. \r\n\r\nThe storyline starts 100 years after the original adventure, with the Cocoon Masters having become the stuff of myth and legend. Beast Hunters are the modern equivalent, and players take on the role of Kahu; an aspirant Beast Hunter.

The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo.

The \"drifters\" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work.\r\n\r\nAs the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve and barriers to overcome.

Since the runaway success of Grand Theft Auto III on PS2, the GTA games have been praised by players and vilified by politicians. All three 128-bit generation GTA games -- Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas -- are included in this box set.\r\n\r\nGrand Theft Auto III casts players as a low-level thug in a grungy, New York-styled urban game world called Liberty City. Liberty City is made up of three districts, and in all, the game offers 72 different missions, many of which can be played in any order. As the player's character completes jobs available in one part of the city, other areas and assignments open up to him. Along with this purposeful design of an open-ended, non-linear storyline, many other features popular in earlier versions of the game return in this release as well, including a diverse variety of deadly weapons, busy streets full of self-involved pedestrians, and eight different radio station soundtracks to listen to while inside the vehicles.\r\n\r\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City offers the same open-ended style of play as its violent, \"M\"-rated predecessor, but in an area twice as large as Liberty City, and with a completely different theme. Seemingly inspired by television's stylish crime drama, Miami Vice, Vice City takes place in the 1980s. Criminals wear pastel-colored suits, bikini-clad women relax on sandy beaches, and palm tree-lined streets are bustling with showy sports cars and zippy motorcycles.\r\n\r\nLike its immediate predecessor, San Andreas strives to provide a wide, deep foundation for its free-form criminal gameplay by setting the story in a slightly exaggerated representation of a familiar (if not glorified) American subculture. As Vice City seemed inspired by Miami Vice, and the pastel-decked, \"me generation\" ideals of the early '80s, San Andreas is set in a time and place suggested by films like Boyz N the Hood, Menace II Society, or Colors. Players take the role of Carl \"C.J.\" Johnson, who thought he had escaped the gangland lifestyle by moving away from his Los Santos home. When his mother is murdered, he returns to the neighborhood of his childhood, only to become embroiled with threats and danger from all sides.\r\n\r\nEditor's Note: The version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas included in this compilation has been rated \"M\" by the ESRB, and contains no working remnants of the controversial \"Hot Coffee\" sequence found in the title's original release.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:28", "rating": "M - Mature", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sandbox"], "publishers": null, "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation 2", "developers": ["BEC Co., Ltd."], "id": 12910, "game_title": "MS Saga: A New Dawn", "release_date": "2006-02-21", "platform": 11, "players": 1, "overview": "MS Saga is a console-style role-playing adventure, featuring an original storyline, setting, and characters, along with fan-familiar \"mobile suit\" 'mechs from the G Gundam, Gundam Wing, and Mobile Suit Gundam series.

Battle and conquest are also important ingredients in a pirate's lifestyle and combat takes place both on land and on the high seas.

A dozen unique fighting vessels will become available to skilled captains, along with special accoutrements that afford the ships extra powers.

It was released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, with Budcat Creations solely developing the PlayStation 2 port, Vicarious Visions solely developing the Wii port, and Aspyr Media solely publishing the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X ports. The game was released on June 26, 2008 in Europe, on June 29, 2008 in North America, August 6, 2008 in Australia and October 9, 2008 in Japan. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith sold as both a bundle with a specially designed guitar controller as well as a game-only package.\r\nThe game is considered an expansion in the Guitar Hero series, extending upon the general features of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. As with other games in the series, the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of rock music by playing in-time to scrolling notes on-screen. It is the first game in the series to primarily focus on the work of one rock band, with Aerosmith songs comprising approximately 60% of the soundtrack, while the remaining songs are from bands that have been influenced by or opened for Aerosmith. The single player Career mode allows the player to follow the history of the band through several real-world-inspired venues, interspersed with interviews from the band members about their past. Aerosmith re-recorded four songs for this game, and have participated in a motion capture session to create their in-game appearances. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is the final installment of the series to only feature guitar and bass as possible instrument choices. The next entry (Guitar Hero World Tour) would introduce other roles to create a full band experience.\r\nWhile Guitar Hero: Aerosmith maintains the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, it has received criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game's strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player's appreciation for the music of Aerosmith.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:30", "rating": "T - Teen", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Music"], "publishers": ["Activision"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation 2", "developers": ["Konami"], "id": 18636, "game_title": "Pro Evolution Soccer Management", "release_date": "2006-03-24", "platform": 11, "players": 2, "overview": "The perfect complement to the highly acclaimed Pro Evolution Soccer series.

If the player defers the offer to switch sides their commander may approach them in the hopes of creating a ruse to destroy the opposing force.

The prophecy also mentions a great and mighty warrior who would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu people.\r\n\r\nHaving escaped Tlaloc's spell, Jibolba believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy and prepares to send him off; however, it appears that Lok has been turned into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice, Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok. Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows the wielder to communicate with powerful Juju spirits to assist him, while he finds Lok.\r\n\r\nTak returns with the Rattle to find that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak collect 100 magic Yorbels and Lok's spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to successfully resurrect Lok.

The game also carries many things over from The Sims 2 on PC, such as wants, but does not carry over the aging aspect.\r\n\r\nThe game progresses much like the other console Sims games: the Sim is given a number of objectives to complete while advancing in their career, and they move from house to house as objectives are completed and the player advances in the story. While the objective in previous console games like Bustin' Out were more career-oriented, the objectives in The Sims 2 do not focus on advancing in a career, but the goals to be completed are more aspirational, like buying better stuff, improving a skill, or beating a bully Sim at foosball.\r\n\r\nUnlike other games, the player controls the Sims directly with the analogue stick, rather than moving them using the point and click to queue up actions. This gives The Sims 2's gameplay significantly more interactivity and enables the player to control their Sims similarly to an adventure or role-playing game.

This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet.

Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time.\r\n\r\nAs with F1 04, \"classic\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France([citation needed])) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original \"aggregated times\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \"Butterflies & Hurricanes\" from English alternative rock band Muse.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \"drive-through\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition.\r\n\r\nSee also[edit]", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:33", "rating": "E - Everyone", "coop": "No", "youtube": "", "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["SCEE"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation 2", "developers": ["Cauldron Ltd."], "id": 23483, "game_title": "Gene Troopers", "release_date": "2006-12-25", "platform": 11, "players": 1, "overview": "A long war has ended and the Galactic Empire has grown but it isn't stable.

The first artist-specific SingStar game (SingStar Die Toten Hosen) was released in Germany in 2007,[2] with ABBA, Queen, Take That, Mecano and Vasco Rossi receiving similar releases in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nSingstar Norske/Svenska Hits are localised variants of SingStar Pop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtist\tSong Title\tUK\tAU\tDE\tES\tNL\tPL\tPT\tDK\r\n2 Unlimited\t\"No Limit\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\n2raumwohnung\t\"Besser Geht's Nicht\"\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nAdele\t\"Chasing Pavements\"\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nAlex \u00dabago\t\"Viajar Contigo\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nAlphabeat\t\"10.000 Nights Of Thunder\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\r\nAlphabeat\t\"Fascination\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\r\nAmy Winehouse\t\"Tears Dry On Their Own\"\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\r\nAndy y Lucas\t\"Son de Amores\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nAnjos\t\"Eu Estou Aqui (Yo sou aqu\u00e9l)\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tNo\r\nAntonio Orozco\t\"Dime Porqu\u00e9\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nAqua\t\"Dr. Jones\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\r\nAsh\t\"Girl From Mars\"\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nBliglad\t\"Dans For Satan\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\r\nBliglad\t\"K\u00e6rlighed Til Folket\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\r\nBlondie\t\"The Tide Is High\"\tYes\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tYes\tN/A\tNo\r\nBlur\t\"Girls & Boys\"\tYes\tYes\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tYes\tYes\tYes\r\nBooty Luv\t\"Shine\"\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nBoys\t\"Szalona\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tNo\r\nBrathanki\t\"Czerwone korale\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tNo\r\nBurhan G\t\"Who Is He?\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\r\nEl Canto del Loco\t\"Zapatillas\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nmoi Caprice\t\"To the Lighthouse\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\r\nCeltas Cortos\t\"Cu\u00e9ntame Un Cuento\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nChenoa\t\"Todo Ir\u00e1 Bien\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nChesney Hawkes\t\"The One And Only\"\tYes\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\r\nChumbawamba\t\"Tubthumping\"\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nCl\u00e3\t\"Tira A Teima\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tNo\r\nCoti\t\"Canci\u00f3n de Adios\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nCulcha Candela\t\"Hamma\"\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nDa Weasel\t\"D\u00faia\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tNo\r\nDavid Bowie\t\"Let's Dance\"\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\r\nDavid de Mar\u00eda\t\"Precisamente Ahora\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nDavid Fonseca\t\"Superstars II\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tNo\r\nDiana Ross\t\"I'm Coming Out\"\tYes\tYes\tYes\tN/A\tYes\tYes\tN/A\tYes\r\nDi-Rect\t\"Cool With You\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nDirty Pretty Things\t\"Bang Bang You're Dead\"\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nDodgy\t\"Good Enough\"\tYes\tN/A\tYes\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tNo\r\nDolly Dots\t\"Radio\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nDonna Summer\t\"She Works Hard For The Money\"\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nEdyta G\u00f3rniak\t\"Jestem kobieta\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tNo\r\nElton John\t\"I'm Still Standing\"\tYes\tYes\tYes\tN/A\tYes\tYes\tN/A\tYes\r\nEvermore\t\"Light Surrounding You\"\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nFaith No More\t\"Easy\"\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nFito y Fitipaldis\t\"Me Equivocar\u00eda Otra Vez\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nFive Star\t\"System Addict\"\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nThe Flames\t\"Everytime\"\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nFormacja Niezywych Schabuff\t\"Lato\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tNo\r\nFrans Bauer\t\"Heb Je Even Voor Mij?\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nGeorge Baker Selection\t\"Little Green Bag\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tN/A\tN/A\tNo\r\nGossip\t\"Love Long Distance\"\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tN/A\tYes\tYes\tN/A\tNo\r\nThe Gift\t\"Ok!

Uses his hair to glide. He is the main character of the Rayman games, he may be somewhat small in stature, but he makes up for size with speed, agility, and a highly likable personality. His theme music uses some kind of banjo-like instrument and is a very catchy tune. He also has a skin of himself called Dark Rayman who is the main antagonist of the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube versions of Rayman Arena. Though it is only one of Rayman's skins, the game refers to him as Dark Rayman. It is the same as Rayman except for his appearance, which is drastically different from that in Rayman: A darker, almost black, purple shirt, with an \"X\" on it, fairly orange shoes, red hands, a yellow bandanna around his neck, and completely red eyes. He is unlocked by completing the Master Challenges. His music is the same as Rayman, because he's his skin (in fact, Rayman is the only character who only has one alternate skin). (GameCube/Xbox only)\r\n    Globox: Rayman's dimwitted friend. Blows up like a balloon to glide. He makes appearances in many Rayman games. He may be daft and awkward, but he has spirit. His music includes a trombone, among other instruments.\r\n    Dark Globox: In the Gamecube and Xbox versions of Rayman Arena, the player can unlock him. He's just like Globox but he is purple with a skull on his back. Another skin has a wolf on the back. He may look angry, but he is actually dumber than the actual Globox. He hangs on to an invisible purple lum to glide. His theme music is like a hundred singing frogs with a trombone like Globox. It was used as Globette's theme in Rayman Rush (not to be confused with Uglette, Globox's wife) .(GameCube/Xbox only)\r\n    Tily: A small, furry fairy. Uses her wings to glide. She seems to be Ly's sister. Her tune is happy and fairy-ish. Pre-release posters of Rayman implied that Ly may have been a playable character, but however Tily seems to have replaced her.\r\n    Henchman 800: A robotic pirate from Rayman 2. Uses the jet on his back to glide. He is a Henchman for Admiral Razorbeard. His music is a rock tune.\r\n    Henchman 1000: An older model of the robot pirate. He seems to be a pirate/gangster/cowboy/salsa dancer robot. Like Henchman 800, He uses the jet on his back to glide. His tune is a rock n roll/rodeo tune.\r\n    Teensies: Two senile old dwarves that work together in a race. One spins the other around the other's head to glide. In Rayman 2 it shows that they forgot who the king was so they take turns wearing the crown, and being king. Their music uses a synthesizer.\r\n    Admiral Razorbeard: Short in both stature and temper, Razorbeard is the robotic admiral of the evil robot pirates. Spins his arms around to glide. He was the final boss of Rayman 2. His theme song uses an electric guitar.\r\n    Razorwife: Razorbeard's awful wife, called Mrs. Razorbeard in the European version and the U.S. select screen. Flaps her arms around to glide.

Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode.\r\nHome Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them.\r\nSudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends.\r\nSurvival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted.\r\nVideo Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed.\r\nTutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works.\r\nThe game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song). \r\n\r\nThe PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs.

It is a sequel to the 2003 game Cabela's Dangerous Hunts.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nAs opposed to previous games, Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2 is more focused on survival rather than hunting. The player takes the role of a famous hunter traveling through many different types of terrain, trying to find out who or what killed his best friend. As with the first game, the hunter has a limited amount of energy and can be injured, which results in failure. There are many weapons, including handguns, rifles, shotguns, knives and machetes. The game also includes many different animals including a boss, the Yeti. Unlike the first game, this one has only the story mode.\r\n\r\nPlot:\r\nThe game begins in Alaska, where the hunter (the player) meets a man named Hugh Andrews. Hugh is a native with a glass eye and a wooden leg. He has important information about the player's old friend, \"Bullseye\". The player practices and then hunts whitetail deer, progressing to fight a cougar and a grizzly bear to complete the first level. The next level takes place elsewhere in Alaska, where the hunter fights his way through wolves and another mountain lion to rescue Hugh's niece and nephew. In the next, the hunter fights wolves, a grizzly bear and another mountain lion to reach a ridge and rescue Hugh Andrews, the hunter's guide, dodging bear traps to reach him. At the beginning of the next level, the hunter fights his way back to the bear cave and then meets Hugh's niece and nephew. He must bait the grizzly with boar meat and kill it.\r\n\r\nThe hunter then progresses to Africa seeking the legendary big game hunter 'Bullseye' Bill Lewis, where the hunter crash lands with the player's pilot, Abby Pendleton, in the bush and must find shelter fighting hyenas. The hunter and guide run into a leopard pair, kill them, and then head to a nearby shelter. Then the hunter must hike to a radio tower to send an SOS fighting leopards, cobras and crocodiles and crossing quicksand. After the SOS has been sent, lions attack Abby.. The hunter kills the alpha male and two more lions to complete the level. In the next, the hunter discovers that the man he came to Africa to see has left to find his wife, who is lost somewhere in the bush. Because it is Holy Land, and because gunfire already makes the animals mad, the hunter can only use a bow and arrow. The player fights lions from the back of a truck until the tribe leader can drive no further. The player then proceeds on foot and kill a hippopotamus and more lions to reach the wife of Hamisi, who agrees to take the hunter to a poachers nearby camp, and states that he was with 'Bullseye\" when the incident happened but cannot remember much about it. In a cutscene a poacher frightens some elephants by firing a shotgun. The hunter has to tranquilize them from the back of a truck before they get to Hamisi's village. Once the player reaches the village, the level comes to an end.\r\n\r\nThe next stage takes place in India and involves tranquilizing tigers, dodging cages, and an Asian black bear with Reginald Dowling, who serves as the player's guide for the remainder of the game. After a cutscene, Reginald is told to get back to the Wilderness Rescue campsite, where another bear is on the rampage and must be tranquilized before it kills someone else. Progressing to the next level, the hunter must rescue a child, fighting tigers, avoiding cobras, bees, and cages. After finding the child, the hunter encounters an Indian rhinoceros and must tranquilize it.\r\n\r\nThe action now moves to Australia, where the hunter meets Wirake, a native aboriginal. He can only speak in beeps, pops, clicks and whistles, but tells the hunter and Reginald that some of his tribesmen are lost in the bush. The player faces two scrub bulls at a river, as well as two crocodiles, having to either kill one and leave the other or get eaten alive by both of them. The hunter then rescues the tribesmen, and the remainder of the level consists of dodging crocodile attacks and stampeding buffalo. Next, the player moves to another part of Australia. The hunter and Reginald are lost after falling into a cave. The player begins the level without a weapon, but after a short cutscene a knife is obtained. This mission consists of fighting off dingoes while escaping the cave. With the new guide, Wirake, the hunter fights fight pumas and wild boars to escape from some Argentinian ruins. After some time, Wirake notes that Reginald has disappeared. He had been chased off by a puma, and the player must rescue him. After finding Reginald trying to fend off the puma with a stick, the hunter kills it and the level ends.\r\n\r\nProgressing to Siberia, the player snipes boars from a helicopter and then on foot, after Reginald realizes he brought the wrong ammo. The player then must travel to a nearby depot, and on the way runs into and kills Hogzilla, a giant wild boar. The hunter travels with Wirake and Reginald to fight wolves, polar bears, and a final group of boars. After that, the player meets up with Benedek and his poachers. In further cutscenes, the hunter fights Big Grimm, a giant male polar bear, and then a Yeti.\r\n\r\nThe game ends after a cutscene showing Reginald and Wirake congratulating the hunter on bringing down the beast that killed Bullseye. Just when Reginald thinks they can finally have a vacation, he gets a call from Wilderness Rescue about an anaconda attack.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:40", "rating": "T - Teen", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Activision"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation 2", "developers": null, "id": 44004, "game_title": "Cabela's Legendary Adventures", "release_date": "2008-09-17", "platform": 11, "players": null, "overview": null, "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:40", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": null, "publishers": null, "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation 2", "developers": ["Sidhe Interactive"], "id": 44044, "game_title": "Speed Racer", "release_date": "2008-09-16", "platform": 11, "players": null, "overview": "The game is a racing game in the vein of the F-Zero series, including tracks full of odd twists, turns and loops impossible by realistic standards, set in five vibrant, exotic locations (six in the PS2 version).

The game was released across various platforms in June 2008. It is about the quest of a giant panda named Po to become the Dragon Warrior.\r\n\r\nKung Fu Panda is intended mainly for children and is based on the movie Kung Fu Panda. Players initially control Po, who differs from the movie in that he possesses a basic level of martial arts skill from the beginning, enabling him to participate in battle. In addition to fighting and jumping challenges, maintaining balance is another important element of the game, such as Po crossing tightropes, staying on moving platforms, and steering a boat through a dangerous river. Over the course of the game's narrative, the player improves Po's skill by adding various new fighting techniques and special moves, although in some parts of the game, the player will have to complete the tasks as another character.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting a number of coins at the end of each level, the player has the option to buy upgrades to Po's moves and health, as well as a different set of new outfits. Eventually, as the player progresses through the game, they'll be able to unlock other characters, including Master Shifu and the members of the Furious Five (a team of elite fighters each with their own fighting styles and mini-games). In addition, the player will be able to use objects and weapons when fighting. Furthermore, before each new level, Po narrates the continuing story, while the words are being scrolled up on the screen.\r\n\r\nIn the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used to perform moves and skills, such as the Wuxi Finger Hold; in the PS3 version, the motion sensors of the Sixaxis controller can be used to control Crane in missions, where players play as him, while in the Nintendo DS version, while the D-pad moves Po, the touch screen is mainly used for combat moves, in the style of the DS version of Spider-Man 3, which was also developed by Vicarious Visions.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer:\r\nThe game also includes a multiplayer mode with new levels and characters. In addition, the game features new bosses, including the Great Gorilla, the Wu Sisters, and Nameless. The player can also collect action figures of the Furious Five and rare coins and use them to unlock things at the Extras Menu.\r\n\r\nReception:\r\nThe game received generally positive reviews from critics. The Xbox 360 version of the game received a 6.5/10 from GameSpot,[3] it scored a Metacritic rating of 75/100 from 42 critics. It also scored 7.5/10 from IGN. It also got a positive score of 8/10 from Game Informer.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, it won the International Animated Film Society's Annie Award for Best Animated Video Game, \"in recognition of creative excellence in the art of animation.\"", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:40", "rating": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Action", "Platform"], "publishers": ["Activision"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sony Playstation 2", "developers": ["Sand Grain Studios"], "id": 44533, "game_title": "Sea World: Shamu's Deep Sea Adventures", "release_date": "2005-11-01", "platform": 11, "players": 1, "overview": "Shamu's Deep Sea Adventures is a video game linked to SeaWorld's popular Shamu orca shows.

It is heavily inspired by J-pop, anime and the formation of musical girl groups.\r\n\r\nThe game's plot, taking place in the futuristic city of Twin Ships, centers around the exploits of three girls - Trill, Cela and Chilly - and mascot Friday as they struggle against the dictatorship of a man known only as Ducker, who can use his voice to exert a hypnotic influence over people and only allow them to experience his peculiar brands of fun, which has outlawed anything creative aside from his own music; dancing, in particular, is especially prohibited. Gathered together by a man known as Doctor Dance - who happens to dress in what passes as stereotypical 1960s attire and possesses a large afro - the three girls form the musical dance group Unison, and set about putting on a series of performances over Twin Ships' airwaves to rally the public to their cause and bring dancing back to the people. In opposition of Unison are Ducker and his personal servants who routinely try to capture the girls.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the game, players choose whether to directly control any one of the girls: Trill, Cela or Chilly. This choice roughly corresponds to a difficulty selection - Trill is Normal, Cela is Hard and Chilly is Very Hard. Once a story cutscene has introduced the song to be performed in the next act, the game moves into a practice session to teach the player the movements necessary to successfully pull off the performance. Movements are accomplished by following the on-screen markers using the PS2's analog sticks to mimic the motions of arms and legs throughout a dance; if a character on the screen is waving their right arm, the movement is likely accomplished by rolling the right analog stick like a waving arm.\r\n\r\nFor the practice session, the song can either be learned in its entirety, or in portions. In the original Japanese release, songs had to be successfully learned in parts, and then as the entire number before moving on. The US release made this process much simpler by allowing the player to keep the markers present throughout the entire game; in the Japanese version, these would progressively be taken away, meaning the player had to commit the dances to memory, making the practice session much more necessary. In either version, the game contains a total of twelve songs that can be played in \"Club Tecmo\" mode (\"Club Afro\" in the Japanese version) with up to three players by using a PS2 multitap.

Each individual has different attributes, weapons and story paths. Players need to eliminate waves of Invaders before confronting a Boss at the end of each area before progressing to the next part of the story. Rendered cut scenes punctuate the action and help the story to develop.\r\nThe survival-mode can be played by either one or two players. The objective is to collect points by destroying the marauding Invaders and blasting objects while dodging the hail of laser-death that the aliens rain down on you. In the survival-mode the game will continue relentlessly until your character's hit point meter reaches zero.

Later on, fans developed new scenarios in North Africa (1940\u201341) and the Soviet Union (1941).\r\n\r\nThe player can roster the crew for each tank in his platoon, based on their skills, which increase over time. New members become available over time, for replacement of dead and wounded. They may also be awarded historical medals.\r\n\r\nEach battle station on the player's tank may be occupied, and the gun sighting may be set to be very realistic. Better tanks become available during the course of time (Tiger I for Germans, later models of Sherman for Americans), close to the real availability of these models during WWII. Every few kilometers there are repair and ammo stations for when the tank is damaged by enemy fire. There is also a multiplayer mode for up to 32 players in each server, and the player gets to choose which tank they may use.\r\n\r\nThere are 18 missions, for German, Russian and allied campaigns. The first few missions are fairly beginner-friendly and easy, and they gradually get tougher and tougher as the player progresses. The game is very detailed and quite realistic, with most of the major tanks of World War II included in the various missions. There are night missions, where the player goes under cover in a captured enemy tank.\r\n\r\nThere is also an American version of the game, First Battalion.
