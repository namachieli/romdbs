Hiryu is summoned by the organization's second-in-command, Vice Director Matic, to assassinate his friend Kain, who has been captured by hostile forces and has become a liability to the Striders. Instead of killing him, Hiryu decides to rescue Kain from his captors. With the help of his fellow Strider Sheena, Hiryu uncovers a conspiracy between a certain faction of the Strider organization led by Matic himself and an unknown organization known simply as the \"Enterprise\" (headed by a man named Faceas Clay) which involves the development of a mind-control weapon codenamed \"Zain\". In the course of finding and destroying these Zain units, Hiryu learns that the faction of conspirators is headed by Vice Director Matic himself.

Afterwards Hiryu locates and destroys the last of the Zain units.\r\n\r\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that though Hiryu was asked to return to the Strider organization he instead opted to retire.

Each goaltender has his own custom-painted mask and the original artwork can be seen inside the game with a special \"Goalie Mask Viewer\". NHL 97 also introduces play-by-play commentary, provided by well-known announcer Jim Hughson.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since EA Hockey, national teams were added, but only Canada, the United States, and Russia have their own teams while the other two are selections of the best European players. NHL 97 introduced a skills competition, allowing the user to pick players to compete in drills such as hardest shot, goalie 2 on 0, and accuracy shooting, among others.\r\n\r\nThis was the first year of the \"Third Jersey.\" Teams that had available third jerseys for NHL 97 were, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Boston Bruins, Los Angeles Kings, Pittsburgh Penguins & Vancouver Canucks. These were the first teams to try out the third jersey. To activate the alternate uniform left click on the teams banner in the controller setup.\r\n\r\nIn addition, each team in the game had one player with a special skill. Examples are Joe Sakic's (Colorado Avalanche) \"wrong-footed wrist shot\" and Rob Ray's (Buffalo Sabres) ability to check an opposing player while still controlling the puck. A major flaw in the game was the glitch that allowed players to score 100% of the time when shooting down by taking a shot against the boards at the hash marks of the left circle in the bottom zone.\r\n\r\nAlong with the PC, Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES versions, both the Sega Saturn and PlayStation version made their debut, although they were rushed and buggy. For instance, the shot speed in the PlayStation and Saturn versions was so slow that some skaters could beat a slapshot down the ice. The cover of the game features Florida Panthers goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:24", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": "Wb5RecQ-3iw", "genres": null, "publishers": null, "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Sega Genesis", "developers": ["High Score Productions"], "id": 4531, "game_title": "NHL Hockey 98", "release_date": "1997-01-01", "platform": 18, "players": 2, "overview": "NHL 98 is an ice hockey video game developed by Electronic Arts Canada.

A magnificent land; one that is not bound by restrictions such as time.\r\n\r\n15 years have passed since Sonic the Hedgehog's first plight against the nefarious Dr. Eggman (originally known as Dr. Ivo Robotnik in English localisations). Ever since, the two sides have clashed nonstop in a variety of settings, with the eventual outcome always being Sonic's victory. Both sides have gained both new allies and new enemies; some helpful, others... not so much. Naturally, throughout this time, Sonic has learned a few new techniques, which he uses to further stifle Eggman's plans of world domination. And so, the world is safe - but always just out of Eggman's grasp.\r\n\r\nSome say history repeats itself. In this case, the statement is proven true, as Eggman returns to South Island, in hopes that he can obtain the land's powerful Chaos Emeralds, and finally put forth a solid step in conquering the planet. As he arrives on the island, he brings with him a single Chaos Emerald - one that had been missing, and had upset the natural balance of the island for decades beforehand. The others were trapped in an alternate dimension; one which only very few could enter, and from which even fewer returned.\r\n\r\nOf course, Eggman isn't very good at keeping his plans secret (a big reason why they're foiled so easily). As a result, Sonic hears of this, and readies his travel back to South Island. With him, he brings two allies: one being Mighty the Armadillo, a longtime friend of his (though they had not spoken in quite some time); and the other being Shadow the Hedgehog who, after finally getting over his angst (at least for the moment), felt like teaching Eggman a thing or two about trying the same thing twice. And besides that, he had never seen South Island before; he had heard things about it, certainly, but never saw it for himself. So, he figured, why not?\r\n\r\nAnd so, the three begin their trek of South Island, each taking their own unique abilities with them, and going their separate ways, each in search of the remaining Chaos Emeralds, and of Eggman, in hopes that once he is defeated, he will finally abandon his plans of world domination.
