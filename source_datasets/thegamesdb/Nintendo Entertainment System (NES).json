When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it.

In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by \"bonking\" them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk's missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small \"smiley\" power-up.  Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.

However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.\r\nThe standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.\r\nThe standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.\r\nCyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco.

In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the \"foot meter\". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits.

Round three \u2013 the obstacle course \u2013 featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller's D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman's Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, \"Dallas\", Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. \"Prizes\" for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best \"ending\" by completing the last obstacle.

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.\r\nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.\r\nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.\r\nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"", "last_updated": "2018-07-06 22:32:55", "rating": "E - Everyone", "coop": "No", "youtube": "4mtYbTmHdYo", "genres": ["Adventure", "Role-Playing"], "publishers": ["Enix Corporation"], "alternates": ["Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation (JP)", "Dragon Quest III"]}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Malibu Interactive"], "id": 1741, "game_title": "Cliffhanger", "release_date": "1993-11-01", "platform": 7, "players": 1, "overview": "Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name.

The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.\r\nGalaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.\r\nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.\r\nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0.

The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on.

A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year.  Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992.  Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form.  Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players.  Enhanced pitch control.  Ability to shift field formations when playing defense.  Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game.  Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired.  Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.)  Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting.  Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each.  New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation.  Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams.  You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5.  Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum.  You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name.  Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves.

These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points.

Each side is represented by a craft called a \"rotofoil\", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled \"droid\" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.\r\n\r\nA player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it, at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button, and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball, his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball, while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent's goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield, and as goals are scored, the goal becomes narrower.\r\n\r\nPushing the ball through the goal scores one point, firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points, and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten, meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent's score to be reduced by the same amount, resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out.

Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and y\u014dkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter.

Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.\r\n\r\nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.", "last_updated": "2018-07-17 03:58:29", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Role-Playing"], "publishers": ["Bandai Co., Ltd."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Micronics"], "id": 26889, "game_title": "Geimos", "release_date": "1985-08-28", "platform": 7, "players": 2, "overview": "Geimos (\u30b2\u30a4\u30e2\u30b9 Gei Mohss?) is a third-person shoot 'em up video game for the Nintendo Family Computer.\r\n\r\nThis game is playing according to the traditional strategies of Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom where players have to destroy towers, alien starships, and tanks with the player's own starship along the surface of a planet with a selection of different space backdrops in the background.

In 1992, the game was remade for the PC Engine which saw numerous changes detailed below.\r\n\r\nCombining hack & slash real-time combat with some basic RPG elements, it laid the foundations for early action role-playing games such as Dragon Slayer and Hydlide. Its hack & slash combat included the ability to both attack with a sword by pressing the attack button and defend with a shield by standing still. It attracted millions of fans in Japan and went on to inspire early action RPGs such as Dragon Slayer, Hydlide, Ys and The Legend of Zelda. The game also debuted the Slime monsters which would later become the mascot of the Dragon Quest series.\r\n\r\nThe game served the basis of an anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk, from studio Gonzo and was broadcast between April 2008 to March 2009. The anime takes place 60 years after the events of the game. A noteworthy element of the anime is the music, composed by famed video game composer Hitoshi Sakimoto.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:34", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Namco"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Tecmo"], "id": 27326, "game_title": "Tsuppari Oozumou", "release_date": "1987-09-18", "platform": 7, "players": 2, "overview": "Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d (\u3064\u3063\u3071\u308a\u5927\u76f8\u64b2?, Shoving sumo) is a sumo video game developed and published by Tecmo for the Family Computer, which was released exclusively in Japan in 1987.", "last_updated": "2018-07-17 03:58:29", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Tecmo"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Sammy Studios"], "id": 27327, "game_title": "Tsuppari Wars", "release_date": "1991-06-28", "platform": 7, "players": 3, "overview": "Tsuppari Wars ( \u3064\u3063\u3071\u308a\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba?, \"Delinquent Wars\") is an action video game for the Family Computer. The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.\r\n\r\nOnce the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (\u30c4\u30c3\u30d1\u30ea\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba?) or Tsuppari Suku (\u30c4\u30c3\u30d1\u30ea\u30b9\u30af?) mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the \"neutral gangs.\" These \"neutral gangs\" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying \"no\" when asked to fight (\u305f\u305f\u304b\u3044?, \"Struggle\").\r\n\r\nNeutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game.\r\n\r\nThat means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either move (\u3044\u3069\u3046\u3057?, \"Not among\") his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn. It is possible for a player to transfer all of his gang members out of a territory, turning it into a blank grey territory without a number.", "last_updated": "2018-07-17 03:58:29", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Sammy Corporation"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Konami"], "id": 27329, "game_title": "TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daima\u014d", "release_date": "1989-09-29", "platform": 7, "players": 2, "overview": "TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daima\u014d (\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30d3\u30fc\uff13 \u30dd\u30b3\u30dd\u30b3\u5927\u9b54\u738b Tsuinb\u012b Sur\u012b?, \"The Great Demon King Poko Poko\") is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up video game produced by Konami originally released for the Famicom in 1989.

Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional features the likeness of Japan's most prominent golf player, Masashi \"Jumbo\" Ozaki - the Jumbo nickname comes from his unusual height for a Japanese male: almost 6'. Though featured on the box art and in the title, Jumbo Ozaki makes no obvious appearance in-game.\r\n\r\nThough by all practical metrics a perfectly standard overhead golf simulator - players take it in turn to get the ball to the hole in as few shots as possible, selecting the direction, club used and power of each shot - the game does do things a little differently than usual. Specifically, the visual cue for the power of the shot comes from the depiction of the golfer himself: The player must monitor the character as he swings, hitting the button at both the apex and nadir of the swing for maximum effect. This replaces the usual sliding power bar that most golf games have.

The object is to earn popularity while performing concert tours through the fictional city. Celebrity challenges are included in the game; they are considered to be miniature games like swimming and kicking a giant ball into a goal in a manner similar to soccer. While these games are fun to play, losing results in a loss of popularity points similar to performing terribly at a concert.\r\n\r\nAppeasing senior citizens by performing gigs at the nursing home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or theatre styles without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances come in the form of talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or theatre styles to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues.\r\n\r\nIn the talent contest, the show is like a tournament where four people compete in a semi-final format. After the judges give their score, the two players with the lowest score are eliminated. The players with the highest score end up competing in a final round where the highest scoring player is the winner and receives popularity points. During the actual performance, the player must choose his or her musical style(s) and must improvise the lyrics. During a televised concert, the game proceeds like in a normal concert. The only difference is that an increased number of popularity points are rewarded for a successful concert.\r\n\r\nWhen the player draws a certain combination on the dice, he or she must go to a nursing home and impress a grandmother with his or her musical or theatre styles. If the player can impress the grandmother with his or her music, then the player is accepted more by the elderly people. However, the elderly people can get grumpy again if the player manages to make the grandmother angry each time that the player has to perform at the nursing home again. All the text in the game is in Japanese. Other combinations of the letter and number dice can create or ruin a player's popularity along with other side effects.\r\n\r\nThe dice combination \"A-1\" is the best combination and it causes a rapid rise in popularity, which means more fans show up to the lucky person's concerts. Getting an \"F-5\" is the worst combination and will result in a loss of popularity. However, all other combinations can have either negative, neutral, or positive results for the player.

Players bounce a ball around a Mahjong table filled with concealed tiles, with their goal being to dislodge the tiles and collect the ones they wish to add to their hand by passing underneath them as they fall. The stage is over either after all the tiles have fallen or the player has a winning hand.\r\n\r\nThe block-breaking aspect is simple: Simply direct the bouncing ball by hitting it with the paddle to first destroy the wall of betting tokens before reaching the hidden tiles. Hitting a tile once reveals it, allowing the player to strategically direct the ball so that they can collect the tile (if desired) and still catch the ball before it leaves the screen.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are various power-ups that are mingled with the tiles. These have different characters than the dragons/seasons/flowers and provide different benefits, such as a partial wall to block the ball, forcefields that slow it down and special tiles that reveal all the remaining hidden tiles.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that as useful as a tile might be towards obtaining a winning hand, it is not worth losing the ball (and subsequently a life) over.\r\n\r\nMahjong can seem a little convoluted, but it plays essentially like the card game rummy: The goal is to collect and discard tiles until the player has a hand that is comprised of Chows (straights of three, worth nothing but easier to obtain), Pungs (three-of-a-kind) and Kongs (four-of-a-kind, worth more than Pungs). The player normally has thirteen tiles in a hand, though this becomes fourteen tiles when they're in the process of discarding one. If those fourteen tiles comprise of Chows, Pungs and Kongs (and one pair) then it is a winning hand and the holder can declare Mahjong to win the round.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this game, much of the game's rules are unnecessary, including betting or indeed any of the multiplayer aspects. The goal is to simply put together a winning hand by collecting the right tiles as they drop. Tiles can range from \"Characters\" (a black symbol over a red symbol, actually Chinese numerical symbols for thousands), \"Bamboo\" (green sticks) and \"Wheels\" (black and red circles), as well as the three dragons (the red and green characters and the blank white tiles), the four seasons and four flowers.

The goal is to figure out what pieces the opponent is attacking with and take them out - sometimes it is possible to ascertain what piece it is with how many spaces it can move, but the most reliable method is to see which pieces it is able to defeat, recalling its place on the rock-scissors-paper chain and then using a piece strong against it to finish it off.\r\n\r\nThe game, like all shogi simulators, was never released outside of Japan.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["SOFEL Co., Ltd."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Angel"], "id": 40540, "game_title": "Kamen Rider SD: GranShocker no Yabou", "release_date": "1993-01-22", "platform": 7, "players": null, "overview": "Kamen Rider SD is a tokusatsu-themed board game., developed and published by Angel (Bandai), which was released in Japan in 1993.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Angel"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Tose Co., Ltd."], "id": 40541, "game_title": "Karaoke Studio", "release_date": "1987-07-30", "platform": 7, "players": null, "overview": "The first Karaoke/Singalong game ever released.

The goal is to use a pair of arrows to teleport pachinko balls around a maze to the scoring zones, and away from the \"Out\" zone. It was originally developed for Arcades and ported to MSX and the Famicom.\r\n\r\nLot Lot is a puzzle game involving pachinko balls and has a superficiality similarity to that popular Japanese gambling game. Instead of firing the balls around a table full of pins that change their course, the goal is to make sure the balls run into one of the four troughs that score points, with the higher numbered scoring zones being preferable. If any drop into the \"Out\" zone, the game is over.\r\n\r\nTokuma Shoten Publishing is a major conglomerate in Japan that mostly publishes magazines, though in the 80s they tried branching out into other mediums as well. Lot Lot is one of their earliest forays into publishing video games, and is the first game of theirs to be published for the NES/Famicom.\r\n\r\nThe player changes the destination of these balls with a pair of arrows: A pink arrow and a green arrow. Pressing the action button will switch the contents of the two boxes the two arrows are hovering over. The pink arrow goes where the player directs and the green allow follows the same path with a slight time delay.

It's great for practicing! Especailly, in the higher skill level, there are time limits (approximately 12 seconds) which enables you to enjoy speedy game plays. Also, it automatically calculates and displays the score on the screen.\r\n\r\nMahjong is a game based on the popular Chinese table game of the same name. It was released by Nintendo for the Famicom and Famicom Disk System, and was one of the earliest titles for both systems.\r\n\r\nMahjong (stylized on cart as \"MAH-JONG\") is a video game simulation of the board game of the same name, a tile-based multiplayer game that is similar to the card game Rummy. Nintendo themselves developed and published the game and it was one of the very first original games created for the Famicom/NES system, along with Gomoku Narabe Renju (another board game adaptation). The game was later adapted for the Famicom Disk System. It was never released outside of Japan.\r\n\r\nMahjong follows the popular Japanese \"Riichi\" rule set and is adapted for play against a single CPU opponent. Three different modes are available (in order from top to bottom):\r\n\r\nBeginner - No timer or penalties\r\nIntermediate - No timer; a 12,000 point chombo penalty is imposed for calling an invalid win\r\nAdvanced - A 10-second limit is imposed, chombo applies; CPU is more aggressive\r\n\r\nA full game consists of three matches, each consisting of East and South rounds, each round further consisting of East and South winds (West and North are not played, so rounds progress after only two dealer changes). The player with the highest point total at the end of each match is declared the winner of that match, and the best of three matches is declared winner at the end of the game.\r\n\r\nLeft/Right and A are used to draw, select, and discard tiles. Up/Down and B are used to select and make calls.\r\n\r\nOther gameplay notes and special rules:\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to go bust; rounds continue even if a player's score drops into the negatives, and Riichi can still be called with less than 1,000 points.\r\nThe Dora and Ura-Dora indicators are the Dora tiles themselves, not the next in sequence.\r\nRed Dora tiles are not used.\r\nIn all modes, there is a 3-second window after the final discard to declare a win; even if the final discard is a winning tile, the game will automatically end the round if the player does not call in time.\r\nTenpai payments are 1,500 instead of 3,000.\r\nRyanshi (two yaku minimum) is enforced after 5 honba.\r\nThe honba counter counts up to 9, but rounds can continue beyond that with the counter looping around to 0.

While ostensibly a racing game, the style of gameplay tends to change per level.\r\n\r\nParis-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However, in order to do so, the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome, a scant number of which actually involve racing.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by ISCO for the NES, Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library's occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity, or a legendary \"kusoge\" (crap game).\r\n\r\nStage 1 - Preparation\r\nIn the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally.\r\n\r\nStage 2 - First Day\r\nThe first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car's speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage.\r\n\r\nStage 3 - Second Day\r\nThis mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player's car to deter them.\r\n\r\nStage 4 - Third Day\r\nThe action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue.\r\n\r\nStage 5 - Fourth Day\r\nAs the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks.\r\n\r\nStage 6 - Fifth Day\r\nInto the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts.\r\n\r\nStage 7 - Sixth Day\r\nAt some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line.\r\n\r\nStage 8 - Final Day\r\nThe Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage, the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["CBS/Sony Group Inc."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Sanritsu"], "id": 40638, "game_title": "Peepar Time", "release_date": "1990-08-10", "platform": 7, "players": null, "overview": "Peepar Time is a Puzzle game, developed and published by Sanritsu Denki, which was released in Japan in 1990.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Sanritsu"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Tierheit"], "id": 40639, "game_title": "Pescatore", "release_date": null, "platform": 7, "players": null, "overview": "Pescatore is a Puzzle game, developed by Tierheit and published by SunSoft, which was cancelled before it was released.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SUNSOFT"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Jaleco Ltd."], "id": 40640, "game_title": "Plasma Ball", "release_date": "1992-03-27", "platform": 7, "players": null, "overview": "Plasma Ball is an Action game, developed and published by Jaleco Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1992.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Jaleco Ltd."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Another"], "id": 40784, "game_title": "President no Sentaku", "release_date": "1990-03-02", "platform": 7, "players": null, "overview": "President no Sentaku is a Strategy game, developed by Another and published by Hot-B, which was released in Japan in 1990.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Hot-B Co., Ltd."], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Namco"], "id": 40785, "game_title": "Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87", "release_date": "1987-12-22", "platform": 7, "players": null, "overview": "Not so much a sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium than an enhanced rerelease with updated rosters.

The Goonies from the PlayChoice-10 range.\r\n\r\nThe game was followed by a sequel that diverges from the movie's story and is better known to US audiences. The game is not to be confused with the 1985 Datasoft game for the C64, Atari 8-Bit and Spectrum which was closer to The Lost Vikings with its co-operative puzzles.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nThe game features Mikey as he runs around various stages based on locations from the movie - the closed restaurant that the Fratellis use as a hideout, the caverns beneath the restaurant and One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship - saving his friends and recovering keys. In order to progress, Mikey must find three keys and the captive Goonie on each stage. As well as bats, rats and other hostile wildlife, Mikey is being pursued by the three Fratelli family members: they cannot be defeated, but can be stunned temporarily.\r\n\r\nMikey can find power-ups that help him proceed. The most important of these are bombs which destroy walls marked by skulls and reveal keys and captive Goonies behind them. Permanent bonuses like headphones (which prevents Mikey being hurt by Jake Fratelli's opera singing) and a backpack (which allows Mikey to carry two bombs at once) can also be found, but only once and each in a specific stage.", "last_updated": "2018-07-11 21:05:39", "rating": null, "coop": "No", "youtube": null, "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Fukutake Publishing Co, Ltd"], "id": 42030, "game_title": "Study Box", "release_date": "1991-01-01", "platform": 7, "players": null, "overview": "The StudyBox, released by Fukutake Publishing Co, Ltd., was much like a tape player for the Famicom.

A Metroid is a floating organism that is dangerous and latches onto another organism to drain their energy, killing the other organism. The plan that Space Pirates intend to do is replicate the Metroids by using beta rays on them. This will turn them into biological weapons that Space Pirates will use to kill any living beings opposing them. The Galactic Federation located the Space Pirate Base on planet Zebes while they were looking for the Metroids that were stolen. The Federation tried to attack the planet but were resisted by th Pirates, forcing a retreat.\r\nThe Federation decided to go with their last resort, which was to send a single bounty hunter to infiltrate the Pirate base to annihilate the Mother Brain. Mother Brain is a biomechanical creature controlling the Pirate Base and their defenses. The Federation chose to send Samus Aran, who is considered the best bounty hunter in existence. After landing on planet Zebes, Samus starts exploring the planet by traversing the caverns on Zebes. While on the mission, she runs into Kraid, who is a Space Pirate ally. She then later finds Ridley, who is the commander of the Space Pirates. She defeats both of them. Samus finally finds the Mother Brain and destroys it. Upon destroying the Mother Brain, Samus sete a bomb with a timer set at 99.9 seconds. She then escapes the planet, leaving the lair in pieces.\r\n\r\nThe player takes control of Samus Aran for the mission on Zebes. The planet is open world with the areas connected with elevators and doors. Samus begins with a power beam that is weak and her only firearm. She also has the ability to jump. While exploring the caverns, the player will find and collect upgrades that will give Samus enhanced abilities and better her weaponry and armor. These upgrades will allow Samus to access previous areas that were not accessible. Some of the upgrades the player can get for Samus include Morph Ball, allowing Samus to change to a ball and roll into small tunnels, the Bomb, which is used while in the ball form and sets a small explosive that can open a hidden floor or wall path, and the Screw Attack, which is a somersault attack that can destroy almost any enemy in their path.\r\n\r\nOn top of the common enemies, the player will encounter the two bosses Kraid and then Ridley. Both of them will need to be defeated, with Kraid coming first and Ridley second in the gameplay. When regular enemies are destroyed, they will leave ammo for missiles or energy pellets to refill Samus\u2019s life. The player can upgrade Samus\u2019s maximum health and carrying capacity by finding energy tanks marked with an E and missile tanks. Defeating bosses will also help with upgrades. When the player defeats both Kraid and Ridley, the pathway near the start of the game will open, giving access to the last area. While going to confront Mother Brain, the player will need to fend off Metroids by freezing them with the Ice Beam and then shooting them with missiles.", "last_updated": "2018-10-29 15:28:48", "rating": "Not Rated", "coop": "No", "youtube": "", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Shooter", "Platform"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "alternates": null}, {"platform_name": "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)", "developers": ["Aicom", "Hudson Soft"], "id": 60648, "game_title": "BOMBER KING ( RoboWarrior )", "release_date": "1987-08-07", "platform": 7, "players": 1, "overview": "Bomber King (aka Robo Warrior) is an action/puzzle game by Hudson Soft that can be best described as a conceptual spin-off of the venerable Bomberman. The prosperous planet Altile (aka 'Altair') has remained at peace for centuries, but in 2036 AD, a mysterious and extra-dimensional entity invaded the peaceful world and turned it into a barren wasteland. The player takes control of Naito (aka 'Night', 'Z-type Earth Defence' or 'ZED'), an android sent to stop the invasion and keep aliens from taking over the planet. Naito must explore eight large areas on Altile, all subdivided into several zones called 'Periods'. Each period only requires the player to find a key and an exit door in order to successfully complete it. However, they are conveniently hidden from view and this is where the weapon system comes into play. The robot is equipped with bombs and a blaster gun - although the latter is rather limited and mainly used to take down enemies, the powerful bombs explode after a short period of time and are designed to clear parts of the playfield (such as bushes or pillars), thus revealing hidden items (such as the key). But, of course, there is a catch and Night instantly receives extensive damage if he gets caught within a bomb's blast radius. Bombs also come in limited quantities and the player needs to constantly refill his bomb bag by either killing enemies or by revealing special icons hidden within the playfield. Additionally, the android comes with a limited amount of batteries - each battery provides a small amount of energy which gradually, and inexorably, depletes. Thankfully, Naito can use or store a myriad of items - Standard items (such as Bombs, Extra Energy, Score Items or Keys) are instantly activated, whereas Select Items (such as Energy Tanks, Missiles, Super Speed, Candles/Lamps, Super Bombs) must be manually activated in the inventory screen (available by pressing select). Although the goal of each Period is to locate a key and the exit door, some levels feature different challenges, item shops, treasure rooms and a multitude of other secrets.

When all dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four ghosts, Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If a ghost chomps (touches) Pac-Man, a life is lost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default\u2013DIP switches inside the machine can change the required points or disable the bonus life altogether.\r\n\r\nNear the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as Power Pellets, provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts. The ghosts turn deep blue, reverse direction, and move slower when Pac-Man eats one. When a ghost is eaten, its eyes return to the ghost home where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue ghosts flash white before they become dangerous again and the amount of time the ghosts remain vulnerable varies from one round to the next, but the time period generally becomes shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the ghosts don't change colors at all, but still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Pac-Dots and Power Pellets, bonus items, usually referred to as fruits (though not all items are fruits) appear near the center of the maze. These items score extra bonus points when eaten. The items change and bonus values increase throughout the game. Sometimes, items can appear several times. Also, a series of intermissions play after certain levels toward the beginning of the game, showing a humorous set of interactions (the first being after level 2, which has a giant Pac-Man chasing a blue Blinky) between Pac-Man and Blinky. Intermissions: #1: Giant Pac-Man vs Blue Blinky. #2: Blinky chases Pac-Man, but gets cut on a white stick. #3: Number 3 has Blinky, whose wound has been repaired, chase Pac-Man, but his entire slime (body) falls off!

Anri, a youth from Altea, defeated the Shadow Dragon using the divine sword Falchion. The Kingdom of Archanea was restored and the world entered an era of peace. However, 100 years later, Medeus is resurrected by the evil wizard Gharnef, who has conquered the mage-state of Khadein. The two form an alliance with the kingdoms of Macedon and Grust in order to conquer the world. Cornelius, the king of Altea and successor of Anri, takes up Falchion and leaves to battle them, leaving his son Marth and daughter Elice in the care of a bastion manned by Altea's ally, Gra. However, Gra betrays Altea to Dolhr; Cornelius is killed, Falchion is stolen, and Elice sacrifices herself so Marth can escape. Accompanied by a handful of knights, he takes refuge in the island nation of Talys.\r\n\r\nSeveral years later, Marth repels a pirate invasion of Talys, leading its king to conclude that he is ready to battle Dolhr; he sends Marth out with several of his most trusted men and his daughter, Princess Caeda. Marth first rescues the kingdom of Aurelis and enlists the aid of its king's younger brother, Duke Hardin and his retainers. He meets Princess Nyna, the last survivor of the Archanean royal family and leader of the resistance against Dohlr. She gives him the Fire Emblem, a legendary treasure given to the hero destined to save the world. The two march to Archanea and free it from Grust's grasp. After briefly invading Khadein in search of Falchion, Marth retakes Altea. He learns that his mother was killed in the invasion and that Gharnef is holding Elice prisoner. Marth next battles Grust and their top general, Camus, who rescued Nyna from execution at Dohlrian hands; he chooses to uphold his honor as a knight of Grust, and Marth is forced to defeat him.\r\n\r\nMarth is contacted by Gotoh, a wise old sage, who informs him that Gharnef wields the tome Imhullu, making him invincible; the only thing capable of defeating him is the magic of Starlight. Gotoh sends Marth to the Fane of Raman to find the materials needed to create Starlight; he also rescues the divine dragon, Tiki. Marth then invades Macedon and deposes the tyrannical King Michalis with the aid of Michalis' sister Minerva. There, Gotoh reforges Starlight. Marth invades Khadein once more, defeats Gharnef, reclaims Falchion, and rescues Elice. He then makes his way to Dohlr, battles, and defeats Medeus, returning peace to the land. If Caeda has survived the events of the game, she and Marth declare their love for one another.
